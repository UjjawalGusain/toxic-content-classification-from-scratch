That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

Because everyone wanted their own special version of Brexit there was no Brexit which had overall support in parliament.  This meant that the hard Brexiteers could derail everything, giving them undue influence.  This in turn is how you end up with a degree of resentment from Stewart and May that people who opposed Brexit didn't support May's *(relatively)* soft version of Brexit.

This is advantage of smaller distributed sources, single failures do not prevent massive holdups.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

Because everyone wanted their own special version of Brexit there was no Brexit which had overall support in parliament.  This meant that the hard Brexiteers could derail everything, giving them undue influence.  This in turn is how you end up with a degree of resentment from Stewart and May that people who opposed Brexit didn't support May's *(relatively)* soft version of Brexit.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

The Nazis were ruthless, as were the Imperial Japanese. All it did was make every firefight into an at-all-costs last stand.   The US, by contrast, is in the main a law abiding military. We almost always take POWs, generally treat them well, at least while they are in our custody, and—at least as a matter of doctrine—seek to minimize collateral damage.  The US is thus not ruthless in the usual sense. What we are, militarily at least, is thorough. We do the boring work. We line up our logistical chain; stockpile weaponry for eventualities; largely leave the execution of military plans to the professional military and so on.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did.

khczgbb,worldnews,"You need to understand the motivation here, as it is very important in the run up to the 2024 election -  The conservative party aim to pick up the right of centre vote - and that puts them in a good position against labour, lib dems and the SNP who fight over a split left of centre vote.  The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.  So we will see the conservatives alienate the centre ground voter, because losing the election is less important than preventing the hard right from splitting away.",ButlerFish,1704980539

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did. But regardless the perception the British press has created is that if the UK rejoins the EU, it will once again have no power to determine total migration figures.

khczgbb,worldnews,"You need to understand the motivation here, as it is very important in the run up to the 2024 election -  The conservative party aim to pick up the right of centre vote - and that puts them in a good position against labour, lib dems and the SNP who fight over a split left of centre vote.  The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.  So we will see the conservatives alienate the centre ground voter, because losing the election is less important than preventing the hard right from splitting away.",ButlerFish,1704980539

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did. But regardless the perception the British press has created is that if the UK rejoins the EU, it will once again have no power to determine total migration figures.

khczgbb,worldnews,"You need to understand the motivation here, as it is very important in the run up to the 2024 election -  The conservative party aim to pick up the right of centre vote - and that puts them in a good position against labour, lib dems and the SNP who fight over a split left of centre vote.  The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.  So we will see the conservatives alienate the centre ground voter, because losing the election is less important than preventing the hard right from splitting away.",ButlerFish,1704980539

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did. But regardless the perception the British press has created is that if the UK rejoins the EU, it will once again have no power to determine total migration figures.

khczgbb,worldnews,"You need to understand the motivation here, as it is very important in the run up to the 2024 election -  The conservative party aim to pick up the right of centre vote - and that puts them in a good position against labour, lib dems and the SNP who fight over a split left of centre vote.  The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.  So we will see the conservatives alienate the centre ground voter, because losing the election is less important than preventing the hard right from splitting away.",ButlerFish,1704980539

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did. But regardless the perception the British press has created is that if the UK rejoins the EU, it will once again have no power to determine total migration figures.

khczgbb,worldnews,"You need to understand the motivation here, as it is very important in the run up to the 2024 election -  The conservative party aim to pick up the right of centre vote - and that puts them in a good position against labour, lib dems and the SNP who fight over a split left of centre vote.  The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.  So we will see the conservatives alienate the centre ground voter, because losing the election is less important than preventing the hard right from splitting away.",ButlerFish,1704980539

You can look beyond that to see how little statehood or self determination means to them by their actions outside of Palestine. In Jemen they decided to try and stage a coup against the government. Fine, maybe they want all of mandatory Palestine.  In Egypt they're fighting an insurgency to try and get control over the Sinai peninsula. Apparently that should belong to them because reasons.  Lebanon however got monumentally shafted.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did. But regardless the perception the British press has created is that if the UK rejoins the EU, it will once again have no power to determine total migration figures.

khczgbb,worldnews,"You need to understand the motivation here, as it is very important in the run up to the 2024 election -  The conservative party aim to pick up the right of centre vote - and that puts them in a good position against labour, lib dems and the SNP who fight over a split left of centre vote.  The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.  So we will see the conservatives alienate the centre ground voter, because losing the election is less important than preventing the hard right from splitting away.",ButlerFish,1704980539

If you want infantry capable of performing real infantry tasks you are talking around 6 months of training.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety.

khczgbb,worldnews,"You need to understand the motivation here, as it is very important in the run up to the 2024 election -  The conservative party aim to pick up the right of centre vote - and that puts them in a good position against labour, lib dems and the SNP who fight over a split left of centre vote.  The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.  So we will see the conservatives alienate the centre ground voter, because losing the election is less important than preventing the hard right from splitting away.",ButlerFish,1704980539

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.

That the freedom of movement within the EU allows these people to then go from (for example) Germany to live wherever they want within the EU. That the UK is seen as a desirable location to them because of the provisions of its welfare state, job market, and relative safety. The perception that the British press has then propagated is that such people are a) economically undercutting British citizens by either taking lower wages for unskilled jobs, or living off the welfare state entirely; and b) culturally frictious with British culture due to education levels, religious beliefs, cultural customs etc.   Now much of this is obviously not accurate, and the UK government could have exercised powers even within the EU to mitigate against the worst complaints, but never did.

The conservatives were dealing with a scenario where an alternative right of centre party  - UKIP - were threatening to split that vote. If the right of centre vote can't reliably carry a 1 vs 3 competition, then moving to a 2 vs 3 situation would be an end to conservative government. We'd have a labour vs libdem competition for ever or something.  Therefore, the conservative party needed to remove UKIPs reason for existing - so it needed to do a hard enough Brexit that it was no longer viable as a vehicle. They did this successfully and you can see how well this worked in the 2019 election result.  However, Brexit was never actually important for UKIP voters. It was just a symbolic battleground - that's why they (as politicians but also as individuals in our lives who we all know) were never consistent on what exactly they were proposing. The promise of that part of the right is 'Your life is tough so vote for Radical Change - shake the chess board and maybe you'll have a more winnable position after' and Brexit was just a form of Radical Change they could promise.  So now we have the Reform party, promising other forms of Radical Change, and the conservatives are once again forced to follow them to the most extreme conclusions of that, because otherwise they will lose the race. Losing to Labour this year is less important than maintaining a 1 vs 3 race - one election matters less than forever.
