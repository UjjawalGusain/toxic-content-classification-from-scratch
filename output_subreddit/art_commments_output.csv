Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

This was not true as it was being created (which is not unusual in the art or the music world). This piece by van der Ouderaa is much more representative of the art that was flourishing and popular as ""high art"" during the mid and later 19th century.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khfh5kk,art,"It's kind of inherently harder for AI to do physical art. It's much easier to get AI to produce a digital image than it is for it to carve a sculpture out of wood. Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images. (The same goes for AI generated text - it has patterns of writing that recur all the time).",auburnstar12,1705011702,0,0,0,0

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khfh5kk,art,"It's kind of inherently harder for AI to do physical art. It's much easier to get AI to produce a digital image than it is for it to carve a sculpture out of wood. Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images. (The same goes for AI generated text - it has patterns of writing that recur all the time).",auburnstar12,1705011702,0,0,0,0

Most of our food is made by the same few companies and all of their design for the most part looks extremely similar. Animators find that studios are extremely resistant to even positive changes (such as having a Black gay main character in a kid's animated show), because major animation studios are tied to their (artificial) duty to shareholders to make more profits as top priority.",auburnstar12,1705012253,0,0,0,0

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

This was not true as it was being created (which is not unusual in the art or the music world). This piece by van der Ouderaa is much more representative of the art that was flourishing and popular as ""high art"" during the mid and later 19th century.

But most importantly of all, it's just difficult to keep a male model's penis erect for the length of time it takes to have him sit for a detailed classical portrait.",AmbroseCaladrius,1704951734,1,0,0,0

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

A slippery slope fallacy is when you start with the original argument, then make a wild claim about a potential consequence that isn't relevant   Erect penises are considered obscene compared to other nudity like female genitals, flaccid penises, breasts, and butts. Desexualizing them in this context does not mean we should start putting them on cartoon characters marketed for children.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"".

khbq230,art,"Most art in the classical tradition is done from a model, a person standing there in the nude or in clothing to give the painter/sculptor something to base the work on. Of course there is an old convention that says classical artistic subjects were not to be erotic. The erect penis was something vulgar, sexualised, inappropriate. But most importantly of all, it's just difficult to keep a male model's penis erect for the length of time it takes to have him sit for a detailed classical portrait.",AmbroseCaladrius,1704951734,1,0,0,0

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"".

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted.

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things.

I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"".

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khfh5kk,art,"It's kind of inherently harder for AI to do physical art. It's much easier to get AI to produce a digital image than it is for it to carve a sculpture out of wood. Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images. (The same goes for AI generated text - it has patterns of writing that recur all the time).",auburnstar12,1705011702,0,0,0,0

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

Most of our food is made by the same few companies and all of their design for the most part looks extremely similar.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"".

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

kh90o7g,art,"SULFUR ELEMENTAL!   Sulfur elementals are colorful and friendly elemental buddies from Periodic Table of Elementals!    Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"".

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"".

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

khfh5kk,art,"It's kind of inherently harder for AI to do physical art. It's much easier to get AI to produce a digital image than it is for it to carve a sculpture out of wood. Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images. (The same goes for AI generated text - it has patterns of writing that recur all the time).",auburnstar12,1705011702,0,0,0,0

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

khimhth,art,"The Lady of the Forest
   
   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models.

A slippery slope fallacy is when you start with the original argument, then make a wild claim about a potential consequence that isn't relevant   Erect penises are considered obscene compared to other nudity like female genitals, flaccid penises, breasts, and butts. Desexualizing them in this context does not mean we should start putting them on cartoon characters marketed for children.

khfh5kk,art,"It's kind of inherently harder for AI to do physical art. It's much easier to get AI to produce a digital image than it is for it to carve a sculpture out of wood. Even if someone has the resources to do that, it's much more effort and money to produce than asking an AI to create xyz image digitally.   At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

Creature Spotlight: Sulfur Elemental   Extremely abundant and found as pure crystals and in numerous minerals in nature, sulfur is a nonmetallic element that mortals have known since ancient times. Sulfur is one of the fundamental building blocks of life and an essential macronutrient for all living creatures.   Sulfur can exist in numerous different forms and has more than 20 known allotropes, second only to carbon among all elements. In its most common form, elemental sulfur forms microcrystals with a striking yellow color. When burned, it melts into a bright-red liquid and produces a blue flame.   Sulfur elementals are generally mellow and calm. They are usually friendly towards other creatures and elementals (especially their selenium elemental siblings), but they often prefer to spend time among their own kind, standing side-by-side to form friendship circles resembling the most common molecular configurations of the element they embody.

   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

Most of our food is made by the same few companies and all of their design for the most part looks extremely similar.

khbn227,art,"Your opinion is a combination of a few interesting points of view:  1-- AI digesting your artwork is breaching copyright. Even though the AI that actually reproduce your artwork exactly.   Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach. Every human work, every effort is a derative of something that came before. Nothing exists in a void. The only way for artists to even make a living in the first place is that have their artwork seen, absorbed, and appreciated my others. I won't get too deep into this, but I really think it's a stretch to think the data from the combination of the colours of a painting being used to _train_ a computer how to paint is somehow a breach of copyright. Copyright doesn't give you a right to restrict what someone does after they buy a print of your painting. They can wipe their ass with it if they want to. They just can't photocopy it and resell it.   2-- It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   3-- Art is inherently human. An alien can't create art. If an alien painted a painting, we would have to come up with a new word for that form of expression, because it has no human element.  Counterpoint: I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise. I think this is too restrictive of a definition, and the reason you're taking this position is likely from the financial hit you're likely to take from the advancement of AI. There's no real reason to think that alien art isn't art. A form of expression that evokes an emotional reaction. The median isn't restricted. The amount of effort put in isn't restricted or specified in that definition.",mesori,1704950124,0,0,0,0

At least in AI circles, for whatever reason, we see a lot of the same ""stuff"". Futuristic cyborg women, steampunk style still lifes, and corporate posters. The AI still has issues in terms of certain small details like clock handles and anatomy, that give its AI nature away. It tends to reproduce a similar style across different generative AI models. It almost always looks ""too perfect"" (minus these small errors). I think that ""sameness"" leads to being fed up of AI generated images.

khcmvr9,art," >Counterpoint: just like a doctor reading a medical textbook and learning from it doesn't constitute a copyright breach, and just like a young entrepreneur reading a business textbook and then taking that knowledge and starting a business and eventually writing his own book doesn't constitute a copyright breach, I don't believe that AI digesting existing data is a copyright breach  Content creators have the right to decide the way their work is being used. Textbooks are written by consenting authors whose goal is to teach, and they are adequately paid for it. ML model creators forcibly take art from artists without even so much as crediting them and use those in their projects. This is more akin to if a big company like [Tesla used someone's art in their product without their consent](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pavn8g/elon-musk-twitter-unicorn-fart-tesla).You're trying to compare two different things. The theft happens even BEFORE the machine generates pictures, which makes the machine's existence immoral.   >It shouldn't be allowed that a thing disrupts an industry that certain people rely on to make a living, while benefiting prior and existing customers  > Counterpoint: the counter point is here obvious. We don't have to go into depth here.   You are refuting a point you made up. I never made that point. My point is theft is bad and artists deserve to be compensated.   > I think my counterpoint is obvious by the way I framed the argument itself. I don't think art exists only as a human enterprise  Art is very much a human thing. Art only has meaning (intentional or unintentional) **through** our human gaze, and it only has intent when made by a human (even when its intent is to not have intent). A machine brings neither intent nor meaning. Bringing aliens into this is a desperate attempt at finding an exception.  But sure. Once you can prove aliens exist and they're capable of expressing meaning and creating art, we'll just broaden the definition to ""art is an [evolved sentient being] enterprise"". A machine is not sentient. Not even machine learning products. And even if they could make art, it would be tainted by, you guessed it, theft.",Staidanom,1704974292,0,0,0,0

   In the heart of an ancient, whispering forest, where moonlight danced through the boughs of timeless oaks, dwelled the ethereal Lady of the Forest. Her form, an enigmatic fusion of shadow and light, glided silently through the underbrush, her steps leaving no trace on the dew-kissed earth. By her side, a majestic owl, its feathers as white as the first snow of winter, soared and perched, its amber eyes reflecting a world unseen by mortal eyes. The owl was her only companion, a silent witness to her endless search through the centuries, a search for her long-lost lover who had perished within the very depths of these woods.
   
   Their story was a tragic tapestry of love and loss. The lady, once a vibrant maiden, had fallen deeply in love with a woodsman. Their love was a secret symphony, played out beneath the emerald canopy. But fate, cruel and unyielding, had other plans. One fateful night, her lover ventured into the forest, promising to return by dawn. Dawn came and went, but he never returned. A merciless storm had risen, and he was lost to the voracious appetite of the forest. Heartbroken, the maiden's soul refused to leave the world, her spirit eternally bound to the forest, searching for her lost love, with only the owl, a symbol of their undying love, to accompany her in her sorrowful vigil.
   
   Night after night, the Lady of the Forest roamed the endless expanse of trees, her ghostly form illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. The owl, perched upon her shoulder, turned its head in perpetual vigilance, its hoots echoing like mournful laments through the still air. Travelers who dared venture into the forest at night spoke of a sorrowful figure, her cries merging with the wind, her presence an ephemeral whisper in the darkness. Yet, deep in their hearts, they knew she would never find her lover, for he was long gone, swallowed by the very essence of the forest they had once loved so dearly. In her endless search, the Lady of the Forest became a legend, a spectral embodiment of eternal love and unending grief, forever wandering, forever searching, never to be reunited with her beloved.

khc4epy,art,"During Renaissance they rediscovered classical art from ancient rome and greece, where a small penis was considered a virtue, a civilized man or god wouldn't have a big dick or an erect one in a painting or a statue.
