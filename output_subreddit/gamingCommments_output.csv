There are SIX EVENTS going on at the SAME TIME this month?   What? Free login rewards? Oh and free daily guild rewards?   Oh? And an hourly play-time reward?

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe. So they fill their games with events, fomo sales, and free rewards to compete with the other games for peoples time (and money, of course.)",XRuecian,1704982328,1,0,0,0

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

khd0q5h,gaming,"You can sightsee, or you can have a challenge.  If you just want to do LFR and look around, good for you, go ahead and have next to nothing on the UI displayed. Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there.

Yes it was pioneering and great but if you actually remember how raids went it is pretty uneventful  Let's say you are a mage. Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

RPG's usually do tell you the objective, but generally just tell you the goal, not exactly where to go and how to do it. But that is normally not needed, because it is usually fairly straightforward.  When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious.

It is the thing that allows the player to see how close they are to dying (other than stuff like the screen turning red).  And honestly a small health bar wouldn't be as much of an issue if the HUD were cleaner: Most games have the HP bar shoved into a corner, but in most games there aren't twelve _other_ HUD elements vying for your attention at the same time.  Watching the gameplay of SS:KTJL on YouTube forced my eyes to keep darting around the screen at the 8 different UI elements because I was never sure what the hell I should be looking at at any given time.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

Essentially it's on the developer not steam if they break the law and if they do, steam will remove their game the second it becomes a legal issue.

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe. So they fill their games with events, fomo sales, and free rewards to compete with the other games for peoples time (and money, of course.)",XRuecian,1704982328,1,0,0,0

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

And what you see as worse, a lot of people will see as an improvement, many games that could not have voice acting will be able to.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet. None of this is true for your car analogy - 99.999999% of people on the planet are unable to help design the next iteration of a car.",Superamdyn,1704980716,0,0,0,0

Considering the other poster child of that publisher is *deep rock galactic* some arses need some serious kicking. Likely some others need to be outright fired.   I'm tired of the ""good things take time"" argument. It's an indie game with relatively fuck all real content.

If you want to experience the story, I'm gonna be honest with you. The story is hard to follow even if you don't find the boss fights all that hard and manage to beat them with relative ease. There's a lot more to following the Soulsgames story than beating the bosses and beating the game. I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club. We've all started Soulsgame sucking at them. You can look at guides, try an OP build, whatever. The struggle is part of the soul of Soulsgames.

Yes it was pioneering and great but if you actually remember how raids went it is pretty uneventful  Let's say you are a mage. Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

But that is normally not needed, because it is usually fairly straightforward.  When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

Yes, it had performance issues, though the game as a whole is a blast. Some gamers here are delusional - there is a reason it sells as many copies as it does. Despite performance issues, the games are generally quite fun to play.   SV added so much life to the actual Pokémon themselves.  When people like you comment, I am wholeheartedly convinced you either haven’t played the game or parrot a random comment you see.  The game isn’t losing players, SV is on track to be the second highest selling Pokémon game of all time.   Yes, they can do better, and I really hope the next games perform and look better. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, the game is great. It’s awesome seeing your Pokémon run around in the world. It’s exciting when you come across that shiny in the open field. Multiple different story lines to experience. On top of that, the DLC (two parts!) was relatively cheap and a great expansion to the game.",No_Wind_8434,1704978621,0,0,0,0

There are SIX EVENTS going on at the SAME TIME this month?   What? Free login rewards? Oh and free daily guild rewards?   Oh? And an hourly play-time reward?

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe. So they fill their games with events, fomo sales, and free rewards to compete with the other games for peoples time (and money, of course.)",XRuecian,1704982328,1,0,0,0

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there.

When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious.

It is the thing that allows the player to see how close they are to dying (other than stuff like the screen turning red).  And honestly a small health bar wouldn't be as much of an issue if the HUD were cleaner: Most games have the HP bar shoved into a corner, but in most games there aren't twelve _other_ HUD elements vying for your attention at the same time.

Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971). The N64 had some serious design flaws that negated some of its potential.",ShinyHappyREM,1704980957,0,0,0,0

Yes advantages of modern architecture  bring it above the PS4 in real world usage but it's actually not 'more powerful' it's also significantly larger than the Switch and gets 2 hours of battery life despite a battery almost 3x as big.  How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is. The absolute best case scenario is comparing it to modern tablets power wise and we both know it's not going to beat an M2 Ipad Pro unless Nvidia has been hiding something insane.  Now I'm sure we will get some 'optimization', DLSS, or other 'secret sauce' that makes games run better than they have a right to given the paper specs but expecting something that's going to beat the PS4 *outright* is not going to happen and frankly can't happen with what's available today unless the Switch 2 is nothing like the Switch in form factor or the old rumored dock GPU makes a comeback.",bobmlord1,1704980681,0,0,0,0

There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro.

When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

The game isn’t losing players, SV is on track to be the second highest selling Pokémon game of all time.   Yes, they can do better, and I really hope the next games perform and look better. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, the game is great. It’s awesome seeing your Pokémon run around in the world. It’s exciting when you come across that shiny in the open field.

There are SIX EVENTS going on at the SAME TIME this month?   What? Free login rewards? Oh and free daily guild rewards?   Oh? And an hourly play-time reward?

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

And what you see as worse, a lot of people will see as an improvement, many games that could not have voice acting will be able to. Indie game devs can now give voice to their characters where as traditional voice acting roles and budget would make this impossible.

If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

You watching the games vfx on a screen to interpret what is going on, thusly, is part of your interface with the game.  VFX are still UI elements, in fact their sole existense is often to confirm you just successfully interacted with the UI to do whatever it was the VFX is there to indicate you've done.  Casted a spell?  That VFX object flying out is a UI element telling you that you did in fact just cast a spell.

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0
khczs28,gaming,"Steam Deck is 1.6TF PS4 base is 1.8. Yes advantages of modern architecture  bring it above the PS4 in real world usage but it's actually not 'more powerful' it's also significantly larger than the Switch and gets 2 hours of battery life despite a battery almost 3x as big.  How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is. The absolute best case scenario is comparing it to modern tablets power wise and we both know it's not going to beat an M2 Ipad Pro unless Nvidia has been hiding something insane.  Now I'm sure we will get some 'optimization', DLSS, or other 'secret sauce' that makes games run better than they have a right to given the paper specs but expecting something that's going to beat the PS4 *outright* is not going to happen and frankly can't happen with what's available today unless the Switch 2 is nothing like the Switch in form factor or the old rumored dock GPU makes a comeback.",bobmlord1,1704980681,0,0,0,0

But I don't want them to oversimplify the gameplay because I suck at it.   &#x200B;  And since everyone with this topic likes to talk about Soulsgames.... If you want to experience the story, I'm gonna be honest with you. The story is hard to follow even if you don't find the boss fights all that hard and manage to beat them with relative ease. There's a lot more to following the Soulsgames story than beating the bosses and beating the game. I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club. We've all started Soulsgame sucking at them. You can look at guides, try an OP build, whatever. The struggle is part of the soul of Soulsgames. And yes, if they included easymode with the normal difficulty, the normal would be there as well. But it still makes me think that some part of Soulsgames soul would be lost.

Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

The 2002 version  has the best collectibles hands down from flavor text and how to obtain them, gnome tossing as mini game got reworked with better controls  and still absolutely hilarious the fact that this isnt in hogwarts or how the incendio challenge is harder than hogwarts endboss speaks for itself.   2004 version what to say about it the best harry potter game, the pot boss is harder than entire hogwarts combined, bean bonus room as well what can you even say about it just an masterpiece, game also innovated on  moving elements like for the first time riding an griffin or using an cat/reptile as traversal literally so many cool innovations there",maddogfarm,1704979228,0,0,0,0

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

khcv69e,gaming,"Scarlett and violet (and Arceus) were not bland - they were some of the most creative in the game. SV is loaded with content, but of the coolest story lines.  Yes, it had performance issues, though the game as a whole is a blast. Some gamers here are delusional - there is a reason it sells as many copies as it does. Despite performance issues, the games are generally quite fun to play.   SV added so much life to the actual Pokémon themselves.  When people like you comment, I am wholeheartedly convinced you either haven’t played the game or parrot a random comment you see.  The game isn’t losing players, SV is on track to be the second highest selling Pokémon game of all time.   Yes, they can do better, and I really hope the next games perform and look better. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, the game is great. It’s awesome seeing your Pokémon run around in the world. It’s exciting when you come across that shiny in the open field.

I just want to escape like I used to. Hell, even three years ago was different. I’d turn on that controller and my mind would quiet for a while. Now I feel like I’m crushed under the weight of living. Mix that with the fact that new games just fucking suck these days. I’ve given up gaming completely. I feel like every aspect of my existence isn’t the same anymore. If I can’t be productive is there a point in doing the task/ hobby? It’s an awful way to live and feels so unnatural. But working 5 days a week just to have two days where I can finally do what I want is insane. I miss late nights with gears of war or doom. But they just don’t feel the same. I’ll play them and for the life of me I can’t figure out how I used to get lost in the gameplay and world. When Oblivion came out I was so excited to explore the open world and crawl through the many dungeons. Now the potato graphics just give a sense of longing for a time when it did matter.

It’s worth it when I find a game that doesn’t hold my hand, but backfires when I go back to play older games that have puzzles so cryptic you need an Enigma machine to figure it out.   Games that make me really think provide a good deal of fun, and on newer games I’m really into for the attention to detail and time the world building team put into it.

Go play almost any Korean MMO, your UI is going to be so full of notifications and information trying to keep you logged in that your brain will spin.   What's that? There are SIX EVENTS going on at the SAME TIME this month?   What? Free login rewards? Oh and free daily guild rewards?   Oh? And an hourly play-time reward?

PLAYER: GIGACHAD97 SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED THEIR WEAPON TO +63?!!?!?   A WORLDBOSS IS SPAWNING? WHERE?!?!  Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet. None of this is true for your car analogy - 99.999999% of people on the planet are unable to help design the next iteration of a car.",Superamdyn,1704980716,0,0,0,0

khd0q5h,gaming,"You can sightsee, or you can have a challenge.  If you just want to do LFR and look around, good for you, go ahead and have next to nothing on the UI displayed. Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is.

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

I was and still are interested in Crusader King for example. But I tried it and didn't find it fun and I couldn't figure it out. Though I would be interested in watching a let's play if a person that I like does one. But I don't want them to oversimplify the gameplay because I suck at it.   &#x200B;  And since everyone with this topic likes to talk about Soulsgames.... If you want to experience the story, I'm gonna be honest with you. The story is hard to follow even if you don't find the boss fights all that hard and manage to beat them with relative ease. There's a lot more to following the Soulsgames story than beating the bosses and beating the game. I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club.

It is the thing that allows the player to see how close they are to dying (other than stuff like the screen turning red).  And honestly a small health bar wouldn't be as much of an issue if the HUD were cleaner: Most games have the HP bar shoved into a corner, but in most games there aren't twelve _other_ HUD elements vying for your attention at the same time.

Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

It's also the one everyone agrees is the objective ""best"" game in the series. Start here. The game follows a 20yo Kiryu and Majima (the 2 most popular characters in the franchise).  Then play Kiwami 1&2. These follow kiryu post time skip as ""the dragon of dojima"" legend. This is where you see him punching tigers n shit like a beast.  Then 3-5. These games follow kiryu and other new playable protagonists as shit gets weird. While 6 is Kiryu only and was a send-off to his character as a now middle aged grandpa.  And 7 (like a dragon) follows Ichiban, a new protagonist post Kiryu, and it's a turn based RPG not an action beat em up like the others. It's mostly it's own thing story wise until the end.

If you run out of fuel, or run too low to jump, they’ll come gas you up and give you some tips on how to keep it from happening again.

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

The game is made to make you feel like you’re missing out when not doing specific things and honestly I’m just more happy cutting it out as a whole.

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

khd0q5h,gaming,"You can sightsee, or you can have a challenge.  If you just want to do LFR and look around, good for you, go ahead and have next to nothing on the UI displayed. Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

And what you see as worse, a lot of people will see as an improvement, many games that could not have voice acting will be able to. Indie game devs can now give voice to their characters where as traditional voice acting roles and budget would make this impossible.

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet. None of this is true for your car analogy - 99.999999% of people on the planet are unable to help design the next iteration of a car.",Superamdyn,1704980716,0,0,0,0

But I don't want them to oversimplify the gameplay because I suck at it.   &#x200B;  And since everyone with this topic likes to talk about Soulsgames.... If you want to experience the story, I'm gonna be honest with you. The story is hard to follow even if you don't find the boss fights all that hard and manage to beat them with relative ease. There's a lot more to following the Soulsgames story than beating the bosses and beating the game. I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club. We've all started Soulsgame sucking at them. You can look at guides, try an OP build, whatever. The struggle is part of the soul of Soulsgames.

Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

Yes, it had performance issues, though the game as a whole is a blast. Some gamers here are delusional - there is a reason it sells as many copies as it does. Despite performance issues, the games are generally quite fun to play.   SV added so much life to the actual Pokémon themselves.  When people like you comment, I am wholeheartedly convinced you either haven’t played the game or parrot a random comment you see.  The game isn’t losing players, SV is on track to be the second highest selling Pokémon game of all time.   Yes, they can do better, and I really hope the next games perform and look better. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, the game is great. It’s awesome seeing your Pokémon run around in the world. It’s exciting when you come across that shiny in the open field.

With that said, they are a studio of nearly 500 people in 6 countries, and the game had nearly a $100 million budget.  So yeah they are a triple A studio.  With that said, when Bg3 started Generative voice wasn't really even an option, so it wasn't like the studio chose one over the other.   And what you see as worse, a lot of people will see as an improvement, many games that could not have voice acting will be able to. Indie game devs can now give voice to their characters where as traditional voice acting roles and budget would make this impossible.  Many games, that already exist will be able to have Dubbing generated from their text.

But working 5 days a week just to have two days where I can finally do what I want is insane. I miss late nights with gears of war or doom. But they just don’t feel the same. I’ll play them and for the life of me I can’t figure out how I used to get lost in the gameplay and world. When Oblivion came out I was so excited to explore the open world and crawl through the many dungeons. Now the potato graphics just give a sense of longing for a time when it did matter.

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious.

Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

I just want to escape like I used to. Hell, even three years ago was different. I’d turn on that controller and my mind would quiet for a while. Now I feel like I’m crushed under the weight of living. Mix that with the fact that new games just fucking suck these days. I’ve given up gaming completely. I feel like every aspect of my existence isn’t the same anymore. If I can’t be productive is there a point in doing the task/ hobby? It’s an awful way to live and feels so unnatural. But working 5 days a week just to have two days where I can finally do what I want is insane. I miss late nights with gears of war or doom. But they just don’t feel the same. I’ll play them and for the life of me I can’t figure out how I used to get lost in the gameplay and world. When Oblivion came out I was so excited to explore the open world and crawl through the many dungeons. Now the potato graphics just give a sense of longing for a time when it did matter.

Go play almost any Korean MMO, your UI is going to be so full of notifications and information trying to keep you logged in that your brain will spin.   What's that? There are SIX EVENTS going on at the SAME TIME this month?   What? Free login rewards? Oh and free daily guild rewards?   Oh? And an hourly play-time reward?   I have rewards waiting in my mailbox??   Daily and weekly quests, too?   A sale on the shop?!   A limited time seasonal gacha box for sale?!!   PLAYER: GIGACHAD97 SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED THEIR WEAPON TO +63?!!?!?   A WORLDBOSS IS SPAWNING? WHERE?!?!  Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe. So they fill their games with events, fomo sales, and free rewards to compete with the other games for peoples time (and money, of course.)",XRuecian,1704982328,1,0,0,0

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

Yes advantages of modern architecture  bring it above the PS4 in real world usage but it's actually not 'more powerful' it's also significantly larger than the Switch and gets 2 hours of battery life despite a battery almost 3x as big.  How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is. The absolute best case scenario is comparing it to modern tablets power wise and we both know it's not going to beat an M2 Ipad Pro unless Nvidia has been hiding something insane.  Now I'm sure we will get some 'optimization', DLSS, or other 'secret sauce' that makes games run better than they have a right to given the paper specs but expecting something that's going to beat the PS4 *outright* is not going to happen and frankly can't happen with what's available today unless the Switch 2 is nothing like the Switch in form factor or the old rumored dock GPU makes a comeback.",bobmlord1,1704980681,0,0,0,0

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe. So they fill their games with events, fomo sales, and free rewards to compete with the other games for peoples time (and money, of course.)",XRuecian,1704982328,1,0,0,0

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.

If you want to experience the story, I'm gonna be honest with you. The story is hard to follow even if you don't find the boss fights all that hard and manage to beat them with relative ease. There's a lot more to following the Soulsgames story than beating the bosses and beating the game. I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club. We've all started Soulsgame sucking at them. You can look at guides, try an OP build, whatever. The struggle is part of the soul of Soulsgames.

Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

And what you see as worse, a lot of people will see as an improvement, many games that could not have voice acting will be able to.

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.

There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet. None of this is true for your car analogy - 99.999999% of people on the planet are unable to help design the next iteration of a car.",Superamdyn,1704980716,0,0,0,0

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

I was and still are interested in Crusader King for example. But I tried it and didn't find it fun and I couldn't figure it out. Though I would be interested in watching a let's play if a person that I like does one. But I don't want them to oversimplify the gameplay because I suck at it.   &#x200B;  And since everyone with this topic likes to talk about Soulsgames.... If you want to experience the story, I'm gonna be honest with you. The story is hard to follow even if you don't find the boss fights all that hard and manage to beat them with relative ease. There's a lot more to following the Soulsgames story than beating the bosses and beating the game. I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club. We've all started Soulsgame sucking at them. You can look at guides, try an OP build, whatever. The struggle is part of the soul of Soulsgames. And yes, if they included easymode with the normal difficulty, the normal would be there as well. But it still makes me think that some part of Soulsgames soul would be lost.

The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.

Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

Unless Nintendo was able to source an affordable, high refresh rate panel, that doesn't seem likely lol.  The other specs pretty much make sense. 64Gb of storage would keep it in in line with the current Switch, but the 8Gb of RAM upgrade will be *very* welcome.

NWN2 has so many skills, abilities and spells with so many multiclassed spell casters that it feels like you're babysitting 6 children at once. Just became frustrating.

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

It’s worth it when I find a game that doesn’t hold my hand, but backfires when I go back to play older games that have puzzles so cryptic you need an Enigma machine to figure it out.   Games that make me really think provide a good deal of fun, and on newer games I’m really into for the attention to detail and time the world building team put into it.

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash.

Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

With that said, they are a studio of nearly 500 people in 6 countries, and the game had nearly a $100 million budget.  So yeah they are a triple A studio.  With that said, when Bg3 started Generative voice wasn't really even an option, so it wasn't like the studio chose one over the other.   And what you see as worse, a lot of people will see as an improvement, many games that could not have voice acting will be able to. Indie game devs can now give voice to their characters where as traditional voice acting roles and budget would make this impossible.  Many games, that already exist will be able to have Dubbing generated from their text.

There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

It is the thing that allows the player to see how close they are to dying (other than stuff like the screen turning red).  And honestly a small health bar wouldn't be as much of an issue if the HUD were cleaner: Most games have the HP bar shoved into a corner, but in most games there aren't twelve _other_ HUD elements vying for your attention at the same time.

RPG's usually do tell you the objective, but generally just tell you the goal, not exactly where to go and how to do it. But that is normally not needed, because it is usually fairly straightforward.  When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious.

Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

For me, I liked passenger missions a lot, so I did that for a while to make money to upgrade my ship, and from there I got really into exploration and have spent most of my hours on that.   And seek out player groups! Elite has some of the best. They can help get you pointed in the right direction. I was a Fuel Rat for a while, and those guys are just amazing. If you run out of fuel, or run too low to jump, they’ll come gas you up and give you some tips on how to keep it from happening again. Membership is also open to basically anybody—you don’t even need a rescue capable ship or to participate in those operations, but a lot of the old guard there are 10k+ hour players, and will be able to tell you literally anything you need to know.",BingusMcCready,1704978707,0,0,0,0

Would've definetly made me enjoy the game an bit more, doenst mean someone else cant get entertainment out of it but sadly didnt hit for me.   2001 version is the goat in quidditch IMO, slightly braindead easy but definetly thematic and captures beatifully the racing against different houses to catch the golden snitch.     The 2002 version  has the best collectibles hands down from flavor text and how to obtain them, gnome tossing as mini game got reworked with better controls  and still absolutely hilarious the fact that this isnt in hogwarts or how the incendio challenge is harder than hogwarts endboss speaks for itself.   2004 version what to say about it the best harry potter game, the pot boss is harder than entire hogwarts combined, bean bonus room as well what can you even say about it just an masterpiece, game also innovated on  moving elements like for the first time riding an griffin or using an cat/reptile as traversal literally so many cool innovations there",maddogfarm,1704979228,0,0,0,0

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there.

khcwzjh,gaming,"There are probably games out there that leave you to figure things out on your own. RPG's usually do tell you the objective, but generally just tell you the goal, not exactly where to go and how to do it. But that is normally not needed, because it is usually fairly straightforward.  When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all.

khczs28,gaming,"Steam Deck is 1.6TF PS4 base is 1.8. Yes advantages of modern architecture  bring it above the PS4 in real world usage but it's actually not 'more powerful' it's also significantly larger than the Switch and gets 2 hours of battery life despite a battery almost 3x as big.  How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is. The absolute best case scenario is comparing it to modern tablets power wise and we both know it's not going to beat an M2 Ipad Pro unless Nvidia has been hiding something insane.  Now I'm sure we will get some 'optimization', DLSS, or other 'secret sauce' that makes games run better than they have a right to given the paper specs but expecting something that's going to beat the PS4 *outright* is not going to happen and frankly can't happen with what's available today unless the Switch 2 is nothing like the Switch in form factor or the old rumored dock GPU makes a comeback.",bobmlord1,1704980681,0,0,0,0

Yes it was pioneering and great but if you actually remember how raids went it is pretty uneventful  Let's say you are a mage. Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

It is the thing that allows the player to see how close they are to dying (other than stuff like the screen turning red).  And honestly a small health bar wouldn't be as much of an issue if the HUD were cleaner: Most games have the HP bar shoved into a corner, but in most games there aren't twelve _other_ HUD elements vying for your attention at the same time.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

There are SIX EVENTS going on at the SAME TIME this month?   What? Free login rewards? Oh and free daily guild rewards?   Oh? And an hourly play-time reward?

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe. So they fill their games with events, fomo sales, and free rewards to compete with the other games for peoples time (and money, of course.)",XRuecian,1704982328,1,0,0,0

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.

It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.

Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet. None of this is true for your car analogy - 99.999999% of people on the planet are unable to help design the next iteration of a car.",Superamdyn,1704980716,0,0,0,0

If you want to experience the story, I'm gonna be honest with you. The story is hard to follow even if you don't find the boss fights all that hard and manage to beat them with relative ease. There's a lot more to following the Soulsgames story than beating the bosses and beating the game. I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club. We've all started Soulsgame sucking at them. You can look at guides, try an OP build, whatever. The struggle is part of the soul of Soulsgames.

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

I was and still are interested in Crusader King for example. But I tried it and didn't find it fun and I couldn't figure it out.

But I don't want them to oversimplify the gameplay because I suck at it.   &#x200B;  And since everyone with this topic likes to talk about Soulsgames.... If you want to experience the story, I'm gonna be honest with you. The story is hard to follow even if you don't find the boss fights all that hard and manage to beat them with relative ease. There's a lot more to following the Soulsgames story than beating the bosses and beating the game. I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club. We've all started Soulsgame sucking at them. You can look at guides, try an OP build, whatever. The struggle is part of the soul of Soulsgames. And yes, if they included easymode with the normal difficulty, the normal would be there as well. But it still makes me think that some part of Soulsgames soul would be lost.

Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

khd0q5h,gaming,"You can sightsee, or you can have a challenge.  If you just want to do LFR and look around, good for you, go ahead and have next to nothing on the UI displayed. Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

Yes, it had performance issues, though the game as a whole is a blast. Some gamers here are delusional - there is a reason it sells as many copies as it does. Despite performance issues, the games are generally quite fun to play.   SV added so much life to the actual Pokémon themselves.  When people like you comment, I am wholeheartedly convinced you either haven’t played the game or parrot a random comment you see.  The game isn’t losing players, SV is on track to be the second highest selling Pokémon game of all time.   Yes, they can do better, and I really hope the next games perform and look better. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, the game is great. It’s awesome seeing your Pokémon run around in the world. It’s exciting when you come across that shiny in the open field.

Now I feel like I’m crushed under the weight of living. Mix that with the fact that new games just fucking suck these days. I’ve given up gaming completely. I feel like every aspect of my existence isn’t the same anymore. If I can’t be productive is there a point in doing the task/ hobby? It’s an awful way to live and feels so unnatural. But working 5 days a week just to have two days where I can finally do what I want is insane. I miss late nights with gears of war or doom. But they just don’t feel the same. I’ll play them and for the life of me I can’t figure out how I used to get lost in the gameplay and world.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

RPG's usually do tell you the objective, but generally just tell you the goal, not exactly where to go and how to do it. But that is normally not needed, because it is usually fairly straightforward.  When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious. In the old games you sometimes have to start over because you were unaware that you did the wrong thing (or left behind/used something you need now) and now progression is literally impossible.",weattt,1704979454,0,0,0,0

If you want to experience the story, I'm gonna be honest with you. The story is hard to follow even if you don't find the boss fights all that hard and manage to beat them with relative ease. There's a lot more to following the Soulsgames story than beating the bosses and beating the game. I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club. We've all started Soulsgame sucking at them. You can look at guides, try an OP build, whatever. The struggle is part of the soul of Soulsgames.

If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.

And what you see as worse, a lot of people will see as an improvement, many games that could not have voice acting will be able to. Indie game devs can now give voice to their characters where as traditional voice acting roles and budget would make this impossible.

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

Yes advantages of modern architecture  bring it above the PS4 in real world usage but it's actually not 'more powerful' it's also significantly larger than the Switch and gets 2 hours of battery life despite a battery almost 3x as big.  How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is.

Now I'm sure we will get some 'optimization', DLSS, or other 'secret sauce' that makes games run better than they have a right to given the paper specs but expecting something that's going to beat the PS4 *outright* is not going to happen and frankly can't happen with what's available today unless the Switch 2 is nothing like the Switch in form factor or the old rumored dock GPU makes a comeback.",bobmlord1,1704980681,0,0,0,0

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

RPG's usually do tell you the objective, but generally just tell you the goal, not exactly where to go and how to do it. But that is normally not needed, because it is usually fairly straightforward.  When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious. In the old games you sometimes have to start over because you were unaware that you did the wrong thing (or left behind/used something you need now) and now progression is literally impossible.",weattt,1704979454,0,0,0,0

You watching the games vfx on a screen to interpret what is going on, thusly, is part of your interface with the game.  VFX are still UI elements, in fact their sole existense is often to confirm you just successfully interacted with the UI to do whatever it was the VFX is there to indicate you've done.  Casted a spell?  That VFX object flying out is a UI element telling you that you did in fact just cast a spell.

Then play Kiwami 1&2. These follow kiryu post time skip as ""the dragon of dojima"" legend. This is where you see him punching tigers n shit like a beast.  Then 3-5. These games follow kiryu and other new playable protagonists as shit gets weird. While 6 is Kiryu only and was a send-off to his character as a now middle aged grandpa.  And 7 (like a dragon) follows Ichiban, a new protagonist post Kiryu, and it's a turn based RPG not an action beat em up like the others. It's mostly it's own thing story wise until the end.

Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

It’s worth it when I find a game that doesn’t hold my hand, but backfires when I go back to play older games that have puzzles so cryptic you need an Enigma machine to figure it out.   Games that make me really think provide a good deal of fun, and on newer games I’m really into for the attention to detail and time the world building team put into it. We’re not getting old, I think we’ve just got a lot of experience and the next generation has a lot to help them get started in gaming.

khd3p6c,gaming,"It was barely ever a parody. That kind of crap has been real for a long time now.   Go play almost any Korean MMO, your UI is going to be so full of notifications and information trying to keep you logged in that your brain will spin.   What's that? There are SIX EVENTS going on at the SAME TIME this month?   What? Free login rewards? Oh and free daily guild rewards?   Oh? And an hourly play-time reward?   I have rewards waiting in my mailbox??   Daily and weekly quests, too?   A sale on the shop?!   A limited time seasonal gacha box for sale?!!   PLAYER: GIGACHAD97 SUCCESSFULLY UPGRADED THEIR WEAPON TO +63?!!?!?   A WORLDBOSS IS SPAWNING? WHERE?!?!  Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe. So they fill their games with events, fomo sales, and free rewards to compete with the other games for peoples time (and money, of course.)",XRuecian,1704982328,1,0,0,0

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

But then again, majority of people tend to like to look at attractive characters when consuming fictional content. That's just how it is.

Yes it was pioneering and great but if you actually remember how raids went it is pretty uneventful  Let's say you are a mage. Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

khcv69e,gaming,"Scarlett and violet (and Arceus) were not bland - they were some of the most creative in the game. SV is loaded with content, but of the coolest story lines.  Yes, it had performance issues, though the game as a whole is a blast. Some gamers here are delusional - there is a reason it sells as many copies as it does. Despite performance issues, the games are generally quite fun to play.   SV added so much life to the actual Pokémon themselves.  When people like you comment, I am wholeheartedly convinced you either haven’t played the game or parrot a random comment you see.  The game isn’t losing players, SV is on track to be the second highest selling Pokémon game of all time.   Yes, they can do better, and I really hope the next games perform and look better. However, from a story and gameplay perspective, the game is great. It’s awesome seeing your Pokémon run around in the world. It’s exciting when you come across that shiny in the open field. Multiple different story lines to experience. On top of that, the DLC (two parts!) was relatively cheap and a great expansion to the game.",No_Wind_8434,1704978621,0,0,0,0

Yes it was pioneering and great but if you actually remember how raids went it is pretty uneventful  Let's say you are a mage. Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

Yes advantages of modern architecture  bring it above the PS4 in real world usage but it's actually not 'more powerful' it's also significantly larger than the Switch and gets 2 hours of battery life despite a battery almost 3x as big.  How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is. The absolute best case scenario is comparing it to modern tablets power wise and we both know it's not going to beat an M2 Ipad Pro unless Nvidia has been hiding something insane.  Now I'm sure we will get some 'optimization', DLSS, or other 'secret sauce' that makes games run better than they have a right to given the paper specs but expecting something that's going to beat the PS4 *outright* is not going to happen and frankly can't happen with what's available today unless the Switch 2 is nothing like the Switch in form factor or the old rumored dock GPU makes a comeback.",bobmlord1,1704980681,0,0,0,0

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

Yes it was pioneering and great but if you actually remember how raids went it is pretty uneventful  Let's say you are a mage. Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

RPG's usually do tell you the objective, but generally just tell you the goal, not exactly where to go and how to do it. But that is normally not needed, because it is usually fairly straightforward.  When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious. In the old games you sometimes have to start over because you were unaware that you did the wrong thing (or left behind/used something you need now) and now progression is literally impossible.",weattt,1704979454,0,0,0,0

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet. None of this is true for your car analogy - 99.999999% of people on the planet are unable to help design the next iteration of a car.",Superamdyn,1704980716,0,0,0,0

And seek out player groups! Elite has some of the best. They can help get you pointed in the right direction. I was a Fuel Rat for a while, and those guys are just amazing. If you run out of fuel, or run too low to jump, they’ll come gas you up and give you some tips on how to keep it from happening again.

When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious.

But working 5 days a week just to have two days where I can finally do what I want is insane. I miss late nights with gears of war or doom. But they just don’t feel the same. I’ll play them and for the life of me I can’t figure out how I used to get lost in the gameplay and world.

However, from a story and gameplay perspective, the game is great. It’s awesome seeing your Pokémon run around in the world. It’s exciting when you come across that shiny in the open field.

But the people who don’t know about it or aren’t interested aren’t going to make a post claiming this.   If a game releases and is overall not good. You’re going to hear a lot of posts of people complaining and find it hard to find the excited posts.   If you want an actual review of something you should be going for game journalists/reviewers that have similar views to you on something you like.

I think right before I left I solo flawlessed all dungeons and that was the most fun I’d had in a while but I did that because the regular content was just so dry and repetitive.

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

RPG's usually do tell you the objective, but generally just tell you the goal, not exactly where to go and how to do it. But that is normally not needed, because it is usually fairly straightforward.  When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious. In the old games you sometimes have to start over because you were unaware that you did the wrong thing (or left behind/used something you need now) and now progression is literally impossible.",weattt,1704979454,0,0,0,0

khd454f,gaming,"Having grown up on the Super Nintendo, then moving on to the 64, I can say that a lot of older games really challenge the player compared to most newer games released by the big brands. It’s worth it when I find a game that doesn’t hold my hand, but backfires when I go back to play older games that have puzzles so cryptic you need an Enigma machine to figure it out.   Games that make me really think provide a good deal of fun, and on newer games I’m really into for the attention to detail and time the world building team put into it. We’re not getting old, I think we’ve just got a lot of experience and the next generation has a lot to help them get started in gaming.

RPG's usually do tell you the objective, but generally just tell you the goal, not exactly where to go and how to do it. But that is normally not needed, because it is usually fairly straightforward.  When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious.

How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is.

Others worth trying Elden Ring Kingdom Come Deliverance (medieval rpg) Red Ded Redeption 2 Battlebit remastered (basically battlefield without bs) Disco Elysium (detective story dealing with mental illness) Hades Wasteland 3 (game play similar to BG3 but fallout vibes) Civ for tactical world stomping fun Cyber Punk is now worth the money  It's difficult that the landscape is littered with such blatant money hungry games.

With that said, when Bg3 started Generative voice wasn't really even an option, so it wasn't like the studio chose one over the other.   And what you see as worse, a lot of people will see as an improvement, many games that could not have voice acting will be able to. Indie game devs can now give voice to their characters where as traditional voice acting roles and budget would make this impossible.

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

The 2002 version  has the best collectibles hands down from flavor text and how to obtain them, gnome tossing as mini game got reworked with better controls  and still absolutely hilarious the fact that this isnt in hogwarts or how the incendio challenge is harder than hogwarts endboss speaks for itself.   2004 version what to say about it the best harry potter game, the pot boss is harder than entire hogwarts combined, bean bonus room as well what can you even say about it just an masterpiece, game also innovated on  moving elements like for the first time riding an griffin or using an cat/reptile as traversal literally so many cool innovations there",maddogfarm,1704979228,0,0,0,0

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is.

There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

khd0q5h,gaming,"You can sightsee, or you can have a challenge.  If you just want to do LFR and look around, good for you, go ahead and have next to nothing on the UI displayed. Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club. We've all started Soulsgame sucking at them. You can look at guides, try an OP build, whatever. The struggle is part of the soul of Soulsgames.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.

When I think of games where you really had to figure things out on your own a *lot,* I would think of old point-and-click games. In the first Laura Bow game you could end up dying in various ways and finishing the game without discovering much at all. The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.  But point-and-click games is definitely not anyone's cup of tea; it can be convoluted and tedious.

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

khd0q5h,gaming,"You can sightsee, or you can have a challenge.  If you just want to do LFR and look around, good for you, go ahead and have next to nothing on the UI displayed. Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

Yes advantages of modern architecture  bring it above the PS4 in real world usage but it's actually not 'more powerful' it's also significantly larger than the Switch and gets 2 hours of battery life despite a battery almost 3x as big.  How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is. The absolute best case scenario is comparing it to modern tablets power wise and we both know it's not going to beat an M2 Ipad Pro unless Nvidia has been hiding something insane.  Now I'm sure we will get some 'optimization', DLSS, or other 'secret sauce' that makes games run better than they have a right to given the paper specs but expecting something that's going to beat the PS4 *outright* is not going to happen and frankly can't happen with what's available today unless the Switch 2 is nothing like the Switch in form factor or the old rumored dock GPU makes a comeback.",bobmlord1,1704980681,0,0,0,0

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

It's also the one everyone agrees is the objective ""best"" game in the series. Start here. The game follows a 20yo Kiryu and Majima (the 2 most popular characters in the franchise).  Then play Kiwami 1&2. These follow kiryu post time skip as ""the dragon of dojima"" legend. This is where you see him punching tigers n shit like a beast.  Then 3-5. These games follow kiryu and other new playable protagonists as shit gets weird. While 6 is Kiryu only and was a send-off to his character as a now middle aged grandpa.  And 7 (like a dragon) follows Ichiban, a new protagonist post Kiryu, and it's a turn based RPG not an action beat em up like the others. It's mostly it's own thing story wise until the end.

That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe.

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet. None of this is true for your car analogy - 99.999999% of people on the planet are unable to help design the next iteration of a car.",Superamdyn,1704980716,0,0,0,0

Yes advantages of modern architecture  bring it above the PS4 in real world usage but it's actually not 'more powerful' it's also significantly larger than the Switch and gets 2 hours of battery life despite a battery almost 3x as big.  How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is. The absolute best case scenario is comparing it to modern tablets power wise and we both know it's not going to beat an M2 Ipad Pro unless Nvidia has been hiding something insane.  Now I'm sure we will get some 'optimization', DLSS, or other 'secret sauce' that makes games run better than they have a right to given the paper specs but expecting something that's going to beat the PS4 *outright* is not going to happen and frankly can't happen with what's available today unless the Switch 2 is nothing like the Switch in form factor or the old rumored dock GPU makes a comeback.",bobmlord1,1704980681,0,0,0,0

But working 5 days a week just to have two days where I can finally do what I want is insane. I miss late nights with gears of war or doom. But they just don’t feel the same. I’ll play them and for the life of me I can’t figure out how I used to get lost in the gameplay and world.

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

I’m so worried about work, bills, the quality of life my girlfriend has and our pets. There’s so much to think about and I’m so stressed and overwhelmed that video games have become a chore. I just want to escape like I used to. Hell, even three years ago was different. I’d turn on that controller and my mind would quiet for a while. Now I feel like I’m crushed under the weight of living. Mix that with the fact that new games just fucking suck these days. I’ve given up gaming completely. I feel like every aspect of my existence isn’t the same anymore. If I can’t be productive is there a point in doing the task/ hobby? It’s an awful way to live and feels so unnatural. But working 5 days a week just to have two days where I can finally do what I want is insane. I miss late nights with gears of war or doom. But they just don’t feel the same. I’ll play them and for the life of me I can’t figure out how I used to get lost in the gameplay and world. When Oblivion came out I was so excited to explore the open world and crawl through the many dungeons. Now the potato graphics just give a sense of longing for a time when it did matter.

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander.

It's also the one everyone agrees is the objective ""best"" game in the series. Start here. The game follows a 20yo Kiryu and Majima (the 2 most popular characters in the franchise).  Then play Kiwami 1&2. These follow kiryu post time skip as ""the dragon of dojima"" legend. This is where you see him punching tigers n shit like a beast.  Then 3-5. These games follow kiryu and other new playable protagonists as shit gets weird. While 6 is Kiryu only and was a send-off to his character as a now middle aged grandpa.  And 7 (like a dragon) follows Ichiban, a new protagonist post Kiryu, and it's a turn based RPG not an action beat em up like the others. It's mostly it's own thing story wise until the end.

I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.

But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for.

His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

Yes it was pioneering and great but if you actually remember how raids went it is pretty uneventful  Let's say you are a mage. Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0

The latter is because there is actual passing time and characters move and events happen even when you are not there for them.

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

khczuwc,gaming,"I think the analogy is decent but flawed. There is a large difference between an industry which provides engineered products that have physical presence in the world and what are essentially digital only products. Sure in a hypothetical sense you can do what you are suggesting with AI to develop a car but there is still significant investment into everything from mining the resources to incorporate into the car, sensor technologies all the way through to the tooling of the automobile plant. Yes you can apply AI technologies to improve all of those and you can zoom into the car design portion and say “AI” can learn it but practically that isn’t how the current AI (LLM) type of solution works. The IP of how to build BMW’s next generation of cars is not something BMW is going to sell nor is it simply available in the public domain. Even for past iterations. You can’t legitimately get BMW’s blueprints without stealing them.   Irrespective, my point about selling my voice was exactly what you said - I can sell it for much less than a voice actor would because it is a byproduct of my work rather than a primary function. This means that objectively AI just made *all* people on the planet eligible to provide voices under whatever conditions they choose - which could be free or paid. None of these people need to abide by anything agreed by a union in Hollywood or a law created in California to protect that industry because they simply aren’t there. Game development can occur *anywhere* on the planet.

khd33yd,gaming,">The other new characters are a lot better. Fret and Nagi are OK as characters and their banter is funny sometimes. And I finally remembered the main guy is named Rindo. But they lack the same emotional impact as the characters the first time. I partially blame this on the removal of entry fees, which I thought really added great depth and characterization to the cast. They also seem to, in general, not take the situation as seriously. Fret wants to live just because and Nagi wants to live to see anime. It's just not as compelling.  I feel like people who complain about the Entry Fees not being in NEO are missing the point because the business culture reflected in the Shinjuku game ruleset makes it so that the team set-up is the challenge in and of itself. The Shinjuku games expect from you to learn how to work with many different kinds of people to expand on your social skills and navigate through challenges as opposed to the focus on individuality present in the Shibuya games’ mechanics. Obviously Shiba’s version of the game is an anomaly so huge teams like that probably wouldn’t exist in a ""normal"" version of the game. But being a leader in and of itself puts that individual in the best position to ascend and gain power within the UG, but the leader is burdened with being in charge of the individuals under them. Meaning they have to learn to balance the two and work with their team. Likewise, just joining a team means you end up at the mercy of just following along with what your leader says, meaning without the ability to actually challenge or discuss things openly, you will also fail as an individual within that team.   Not to mention that, narratively, the Player psychs are equivalent of the Entry Fees in NEO’s story since they’re used to give you extra insight into the characters and their struggles though to be fair, this is something you have to gleam from beyond the surface level.   Take Rindo’s Replay for example, which I find to be a very interesting double-edged sword when how it showcases his growth. On the one hand, it does enable his indecisiveness because he can always go back and undo it, which is a mindset he falls into such as when he constantly rewinds to see what Motoi and Shoka were talking about and how he resigns himself to thinking he’ll have to rewind yet again when he gets a vision. But because he HAS to undo his previous indecisiveness, it also forces him to be decisive, because his life is on the line. He has to speak up, he has to think harder, he has to make decisions. It does initially let him get out of the consequences of being indecisive but only by giving him a chance to go back and be decisive. Then that same indecisiveness comes to bite him in the ass spectacularly in the form of the Dissonance Noise. So while he does grow bit by bit thanks to the nature of Replay, his previous indecisiveness still comes back to haunt him, forcing him to ultimately confront his insecurities in the ending and work his ass off to achieve what he’s fighting for. Your complaints about the characters not taking the game seriously are also odd because that’s by intention and has several factors at play. Unlike Neku, the characters aren’t immediately shown what happens if you get erased on the first day and they only find out what that entails on the very last day of the first week, with the crew not taking anything seriously up to that point. And then there’s Sho, who throughout his interactions with the Wicked Twisters acts as the equivalent of a sink-or-swim mentor to them and constantly pushes them to step up to the plate. However, Sho pushes the team forward, they still overly rely on him because he’s the one with the most experience and power out of all them, which is reflected in the party’s stats and his being noticeably higher than the others. With him around, they don’t necessarily need to try as hard as they should be doing and thus don’t connect as much throughout Week 1 since their struggles aren’t dire enough at this point and they aren’t aware of the full stakes, hence why the Groove meter caps out at 100%. However, that all changes when Week 2 rolls around and Sho up and dips from the party. Now they HAVE to put in more effort to make up for the fact that the dude who contributed the most to their overall stats and team strength/defensive capabilities is now gone.  With Sho gone, tensions are now rising between Rindo and Fret, with the stress of the situation getting them to make constant pot-shots at one another, which isn’t going to be very helpful for building team synergy and there’s where Beat comes in, who’s there to help bring the party’s spirits back up after getting cheated out of their victory at the end of Week 1 and counter against anyone who gives them shit such as Kubo or the other Player teams. His integration within the team allows the more cautious members of the team, Rindo and Nagi, to come out of their shell more and he provides Fret with another lighthearted figure to bounce off of in an actual genuine manner.  >Several characters return but I can't talk too much about that without spoilers. Other than Minamimoto, who is on the cover. He's literally only there to bait people nostalgic for TWEWY in. I'm not going to say he does nothing, but 95% of his existence is to pander. The other returning characters are either exactly the same they were the first time or are just shells of themselves. They've gone through their development and the 2nd game gives them nothing new as far as arcs or development goes.  Yeah, I do not agree with this take at all. Take Uzuki for example, where the first TWEWY had her act as an overly enthusiastic go-getter who constantly sucked up to Reapers like Konishi in order to try and get her promotion only for her to realize that she and the other Reapers are just seen as tools for the head leads. NEO expands on this even more and has her struggling between deciding whether she should keep following orders to prevent even more Reapers from dying under the hands of Shiba or fighting for Shibuya’s sake, which culminates in her going “fuck it” and being willing to go against the rules of the Reaper hierarchy and protect Shibuya even against orders",mageknight14,1704982085,0,0,0,0

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.

But I don't want them to oversimplify the gameplay because I suck at it.   &#x200B;  And since everyone with this topic likes to talk about Soulsgames.... If you want to experience the story, I'm gonna be honest with you. The story is hard to follow even if you don't find the boss fights all that hard and manage to beat them with relative ease. There's a lot more to following the Soulsgames story than beating the bosses and beating the game. I'm a bit more observant about the stories now but I still watch lore videos and learn tons of new stuff.  If you want to ""play"" Soulsgames but find them too hard, welcome to the club. We've all started Soulsgame sucking at them. You can look at guides, try an OP build, whatever. The struggle is part of the soul of Soulsgames. And yes, if they included easymode with the normal difficulty, the normal would be there as well. But it still makes me think that some part of Soulsgames soul would be lost.

khd0fbd,gaming,"> Didn't SEGA beat Nintendo to the 16 bit console [...] with the Genesis?  It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971).

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

Yes advantages of modern architecture  bring it above the PS4 in real world usage but it's actually not 'more powerful' it's also significantly larger than the Switch and gets 2 hours of battery life despite a battery almost 3x as big.  How a phone GPU is relevant is the switch is going to be using 'mobile' aka phone hardware not what's being used in PC gaming handhelds which are significantly larger and hotter and more power hungry than what the switch is. The absolute best case scenario is comparing it to modern tablets power wise and we both know it's not going to beat an M2 Ipad Pro unless Nvidia has been hiding something insane.  Now I'm sure we will get some 'optimization', DLSS, or other 'secret sauce' that makes games run better than they have a right to given the paper specs but expecting something that's going to beat the PS4 *outright* is not going to happen and frankly can't happen with what's available today unless the Switch 2 is nothing like the Switch in form factor or the old rumored dock GPU makes a comeback.",bobmlord1,1704980681,0,0,0,0

khd0q5h,gaming,"You can sightsee, or you can have a challenge.  If you just want to do LFR and look around, good for you, go ahead and have next to nothing on the UI displayed. Your damage is pretty irrelevent and you can take in the atmosphere and RP of the game while still seeing the same fights in essence as the top of the top.   It's your path to carve and it's great you want to do that.    If you want a challenge, and the stuff that generally will get watched on twitch it needs to be higher difficulty, usually the highest (mythic) and for that it's not about sightseeing, its about highly calculated decisions.  For that you need a lot of information available at a moments notice... when is the next boss ability coming, is someone in your raid who was assigned to something dead, are you saving your big nuke for the next wave of ads, is your damage amplification buff/debuff about to drop, how low is your health, when is your defensive off cooldown, have you been selected by the boss to do the thing... and that's all before you take on a more leadership role where you need to know cooldowns of the whole raids group defensives.    Play the game you want to play, but understand that the more challenging stuff is more challenge.  it's this pick and mix 'I want the best rewards and the achievements saying I did the hardest thing... but I don't want to have to like... do anything for it'   WoW is *very* diverse with how neckbeard you want to go.  You can spend your time picking flowers and pokemon battles, or you can group with a 20 man raid and work together on an incredibly hard challenge.

It has a (usually expensive) CPU originally developed for home computers / personal computers, with a mix of different bit widths:  - 32-bit instruction set - 8 32-bit data registers - 8 32-bit address registers - 16-bit internal data bus - 16-bit arithmetic/logic unit (ALU) - 2 16-bit ALUs used mostly for addresses - 16-bit external data bus - 24-bit address bus  Programs that are careful to work with 16-bit data kept in the registers can achieve the most speed, otherwise they are slowed down by the ALUs and the data buses. The Genesis has a much higher system clock than the SNES, but in the end [the instructions per second are comparable to the SNES](https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/mc68000-7-6-mhz-compared-to-65c816-3-58mhz.2111683/page-2#post-40136542).  The SNES also has a 24-bit address bus, but is kneecapped by its NES backwards compatibility (very few 16-bit registers, 8-bit data bus). It has more memory (128 KiB work RAM and 64 KiB audio RAM) and [arguably](https://youtu.be/Au_CTlKU_7o) the better [audio](https://youtu.be/dtK0t8k6akg) technology. On the graphics side it renders more pixels than the Genesis (512 vs. 320 per line), which most games used for transparency effects (256 additions/subtractions per line) with a [larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System) color palette. The biggest innovation imo was [Mode 7](https://youtu.be/K7gWmdgXPgk?t=858) which wasn't available for the Genesis until the SEGA CD (and seems rather different and complicated [under the hood](https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/scd-graphics-documentation.40560/)).  ---  > by a year  Two years actually (though the SNES hardware [was also almost ready in 1988](https://www.chrismcovell.com/secret/SFC_1988Q4.html)).  ---  > The only time they really were advanced was with the NES, the Gameboy, and the N64.  The NES was certainly better than what remained after the 1980s videogame market crash. The Gameboy was arguably better simply by being less power-hungry [than the competition](https://youtu.be/wSy3kAHtmF8?t=971). The N64 had some serious design flaws that negated some of its potential.",ShinyHappyREM,1704980957,0,0,0,0

There are SIX EVENTS going on at the SAME TIME this month?   What? Free login rewards? Oh and free daily guild rewards?   Oh? And an hourly play-time reward?

Kinda sucks, cause often the Korean MMOs are actually good games, but the PC-Cafe player focused design often ruins it a bit for the international scene. The reason there are always login rewards and hourly rewards and SEVERAL events going on at once is because many, if not most players in Korea play from a PC-Cafe. That means your game needs to have things in  it that will cause players to log into YOUR game instead of one of the other popular games in the Cafe. So they fill their games with events, fomo sales, and free rewards to compete with the other games for peoples time (and money, of course.)",XRuecian,1704982328,1,0,0,0

khcw76c,gaming,"In all honesty, this entire essay just feels like you only looked at the game from a surface-level and didn’t really take enough time or opportunity to actually give it a thorough exploration so I’ll be addressing a lot of what you have to say.  >>The art style transitioned pretty good into 3D, but it lost the comic book ascetic that I really liked about the first game. I'm not a huge fan of the music this time around but that's a personal taste thing.  The comic-book aesthetic is still present in just about every aspect of the dialogue sections and arguably feel like expansions on the first game’s style. The devs actually get pretty creative with the paneling to sell the emotions/intent of a scene and spread across tons of unique assets amongst the cast, with tons of cool panning shots to boot. In the original, Neku had 17 poses to carry him through the game, whereas Rindo has 287 art assets assigned to him. Sure, a lot of those are taken up by granular tweaks to his facial expressions so it's not exactly a completely fair comparison, but when you think about how that scales across multiple characters, it puts it leaps and bounds ahead. Rindo and Fret’s first interaction in the game as well as the scene where they try to recruit Nagi are also good examples of this.   >>The characters and story are where my opinions really start to dip. I'm going to be honest, just sitting here writing this, I'm struggling to even remember the main character's name. He's just so fucking boring and I don't see much improvement. He, allegedly, has a character arc about having more agency in his life or something but I really don't see it. He's just passive almost the entire time. I can't go into details but the one time I felt he really took control of the story it was to do the dumbest and most selfish thing he possibly could at that moment.  The thing about Rindo is that while people tend to boil down his arc to just being about his indecisiveness, it's a bit more nuanced than that. What makes Rindo's kind of indecisiveness problematic was his complacency and comfortableness with letting other people make decisions he'd rather not commit to. The moment someone comes around who seems capable, he's quick to obscuring himself into the background and riding on the coattails of other people's capabilities. I personally didn't need Rindo to have some dramatic internal conflict like self-deprecation, vanity, or depression. What matters when it comes to writing a character's flaw is how well the writing illustrates that flaw and I found that NEO painted Rindo's anxieties vividly whenever he was fraught with challenges. Most of the game, we see Rindo in his head, neurotically commentating on every move he or someone else does. It's shit like that that builds character; seeing Rindo feel things makes you care about him, even if his indecisiveness may grate at you sometimes, you understand why he is that way based on what's established about his character.    Nagi’s Dive into his head on W1D3 actually does a LOT to reveal aspects of his character: he puts other people at arm’s length (besides Swallow due to their online anonymity) because he’s afraid of the fallout of what would to happen if he got involved with them.  ""What if I end up taking on more than I can handle? What if other people end up dragging me down with them? If I just stay at the sidelines and shift the blame onto others, I won’t get into trouble for this.""   This culminates into him latching onto others he finds capable and taking the relationships around him for granted, tying other people's worth to their prowess in might or influence. After all, why bother relying on yourself and others when you can just rely on someone else for you to solve your problems? Especially since it means that if everything goes south, YOU won’t take the fallout for it. After all, they’re clearly much more capable than you are. He has little to no faith in himself or others and this also leads into him becoming incredibly paranoid around others and their capabilities, fearing what would happen to him even if there’s no other alternative.  His friendship with Fret is also really interesting and I wish the intro section revolving around them got appreciated more for embodying a reasonable teenage friendship that feels more real than I think people give it credit for. Fret and Rindo's early dynamic is fully on display where Fret drags Rindo around because he is somewhat a social person who needs someone to talk to, and Rindo just casually goes with it because he's passive and doesn't mind letting Fret talk about whatever he wants. Rindo has little understanding of Fret as a person (and Fret doesn't know Rindo either very well) when Fret talks about his interests in fashion, and Fret is just fine with that given what we learn at the end with how he's kind of purposefully distant and false because of a friend's implied suicide that's caused him to just hold back his real feelings. So Rindo gives him an easy person to talk to because Rindo doesn't really care enough to know Fret and that's the way Fret likes it. Because it lets him just ignore his problems and talk to Rindo about whatever latest thing he's been doing recently so he can just ignore his past issues and not get close to anyone. Rindo being so passive will never initiate any kind of bond with Fret which lets Fret be safe.  Rindo and Fret are just really casual teenage friends who keep each other at a far distance, not some life long buddies since they were 8 or whatever like I'd expect from a dynamic like this on first pass in a JRPG. There's so many little details upon second glance that really add up to a lot. It's such a shame it all is so mundane when you first see it and that colors people really badly.   The thing about NEO is that it’s a LOT more subtle compared to the original and it achieves this ""show, don't tell"" approach through allowing the characters' behaviors, subtle sprite changes, variable personality traits, and actions to paint a detailed picture of who they are, what their conflicts are, and how they represent the larger themes at play in the story; all of this is a product of writing choices: writing dialogue that expresses intent more purposefully and arises in conversation more organically; utilizing writing choices with a larger emphasize on a characters' actions; their emotional responses; their mannerisms and the consequences of their psychology to do the explaining, rather than them just stating how they feel; it's the reason why NEO requires a bit more combing through to pick up on what its putting down with its cast. NEO establishes well-thought out cause and effect character writing and relies on that to convey its narrative as opposed to just describing these things to the audience.",mageknight14,1704979098,0,0,0,0

khd03vv,gaming,"Like with any other game, randoms will always be a mixed bag and you'll never know if you'll get good or bad players. However with Deep Rock Galactic, the game naturally incentivizes co-operation so random players will be discouraged from being selfish and useless:  * Voice chat is NOT NEEDED to communicate with the team since the game has a laser pointer ping system with the Dwarves shouting contextual voice lines for whatever you're pinging which is usually enough to give other players an idea of what you're trying to do. * Each class has a support tool that benefits both themselves and the team. Because using it helps yourself, it will incidentally help the team even if you're not actively trying to be a team-player. And if you ARE a team-player, then the efficiency of these tools gets much better. * All resources are shared and deposited in your robotic carrier MULE. Since there's only one of these things in the mission, all players are encouraged to be near it to deposit any collected resources (since any resources in your pockets cannot be used nor do they count towards mission objectives). Only one player can summon the MULE at any one time, while you might get into an annoying tug of war with 2 players summoning the MULE from opposite ends of the cave, eventually 1 player will give up when they realize this is a massive waste of time compared to just regrouping with the others and following the MULE to deposit their stuff. * Some enemies have the ability to completely disable you and cause you to die (sort of like the special infected from Left4Dead) and can only be stopped by a teammate shooting them. This means you're fucked if you wander off alone and get ambushed by one of these things. So it's more practical to stay close to the group so people can shoot any enemy that catches you unaware. * If you do die, you will be downed and will STAY down until a teammate comes to pick you up. If you're far away from your team, this means you will be waiting a LONG time before you can start playing again because they need to travel an entire cave network to reach you. But if you're nearby, chances are your team can get you back in the fight immediately if they can handle the ongoing threat well enough to rescue you.  While there will still be idiots who don't understand these mechanics and will be a liability to the team, the fact that the game design rewards you for team-play and punishes you for not sticking together means that consistent players will eventually get the message and be more helpful because it's simply more practical for many reasons.",ZepyrusG97,1704980822,0,0,0,0

Would've definetly made me enjoy the game an bit more, doenst mean someone else cant get entertainment out of it but sadly didnt hit for me.   2001 version is the goat in quidditch IMO, slightly braindead easy but definetly thematic and captures beatifully the racing against different houses to catch the golden snitch.     The 2002 version  has the best collectibles hands down from flavor text and how to obtain them, gnome tossing as mini game got reworked with better controls  and still absolutely hilarious the fact that this isnt in hogwarts or how the incendio challenge is harder than hogwarts endboss speaks for itself.   2004 version what to say about it the best harry potter game, the pot boss is harder than entire hogwarts combined, bean bonus room as well what can you even say about it just an masterpiece, game also innovated on  moving elements like for the first time riding an griffin or using an cat/reptile as traversal literally so many cool innovations there",maddogfarm,1704979228,0,0,0,0

khd4alq,gaming,"Wolfenstein was before Doom. Making Wolfenstein the real granddaddy of all shooters.     Wolfenstein had it first.     However Wolfenstein and Doom were both made by ID Software. Same people.     Everyone thinks Doom is the original, but it's not.     The whole vision went like this: ""Wolfenstein is based upon WW2. Killing Nazis. Doom is based upon going to hell, killing those Nazi's again""     Therefore, even in Story line, Wolfenstein is first. Just how it was made in real life.

I still don't play the BR. I found myself really enjoying the creative maps, particularly the Tycoon games. I just launch one up, mindlessly upgrade, and see what people have built. I have a good time doing it and I'll occasionally switch modes to other creative maps or go back to Save the World since it exists again with all your previous progress.

khcwhiv,gaming,"As someone that nearly played all harry potter games across gameboy to pc, hogwarts is not even in my top 3. i would've loved an endgame DLC with more map content, minigames, bosses and collectibles. Would've definetly made me enjoy the game an bit more, doenst mean someone else cant get entertainment out of it but sadly didnt hit for me.   2001 version is the goat in quidditch IMO, slightly braindead easy but definetly thematic and captures beatifully the racing against different houses to catch the golden snitch.     The 2002 version  has the best collectibles hands down from flavor text and how to obtain them, gnome tossing as mini game got reworked with better controls  and still absolutely hilarious the fact that this isnt in hogwarts or how the incendio challenge is harder than hogwarts endboss speaks for itself.   2004 version what to say about it the best harry potter game, the pot boss is harder than entire hogwarts combined, bean bonus room as well what can you even say about it just an masterpiece, game also innovated on  moving elements like for the first time riding an griffin or using an cat/reptile as traversal literally so many cool innovations there",maddogfarm,1704979228,0,0,0,0

khcwxj6,gaming,"to be fair at least in classic wow there really wasn't much playing most of the time. Yes it was pioneering and great but if you actually remember how raids went it is pretty uneventful  Let's say you are a mage. Log in early and start making bread/water while everyone else does their own chores. Ok, now we go in and go through the starter mobs on the way to the first boss.  Tank goes in, and does the first skills to build up aggro. Now you turn on your script for single target dps and watch the aggro bar to make sure you never go above the tank. If at any time you get close you turn off the script and switch to wand damage while it goes down. Everyone knows what you are doing so no one complains.   At half hp the boss does 'the move' so you know to move to the side while the additional enemies flood in. The offtank runs over and draws their aggro. Ok now you switch to the aoe script and target them until they go down then switch to single target again for the main boss.   &#x200B;  It didn't really matter what boss you were against in what dungeon sure you had to know what triggers happen to do the right response but few roles really had to do anything more elaborate.",skaliton,1704979429,0,0,0,0
