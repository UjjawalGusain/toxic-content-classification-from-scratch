As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle.

Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival. If more people vote, they lose every time.",AtheistAustralis,1704982150,0,0,0,0

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

And anything after the second trimester could be regulated, but not outlawed in the interest of the mothers health.. you know, a non-viable dead fetus and a septic mother? Those are the cases where late-term abortions are necessary. Also, you can not name a single person who really believes a woman should be able to have an abortion anytime, anywhere up to 9 months, like the right continues to lie about.

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

In 2024 by benefits went up by $35, my food benefits went down by $32 and my meds started started costing me $20 a month. So there’s a an SSI “raise” of -$15.   My mom is elderly. She has to pay for Medicare. Her benefits went up by $54 and costs increased by $120. As a 75 year old. They sent literature suggesting we both get job training for a certificate in labor.  They’re just trying to starve us out of the system and then blame all of its problems on us like we’re over here sipping mai tais and eating filet on vacation in the Bahamas while working people suffer a Dickensian nightmare here.

Trump famously did not, he just handed it off to his stooges and mumbled some platitudes for the camera. Nothing legally or practically changed when he assumed office, something Democrats glaringly pointed to. Democrats pointed to how he blatantly accepted gifts by foreign governments directly, against direct law forbidding a president to do so, but Trump continues to push his ""invulnerability"" claim all the way to... Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress. The clause is intended to prevent corruption and foreign influence on the federal officials",DropsTheMic,1704982503,0,0,0,0

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children.

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want.

khd5q5r,politics,"In addition to the other comments, but being able to sell ammo to both the US military and civilians allows the plant to produce more. With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.  House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) [agreed last weekend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/07/congress-budget-deal/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) to rescind IRS funding as part of 2024 budget negotiations, although the deal must still pass Congress.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

Whatever that means.  I hope that in the future ""businessman"" gains the same stigma as ""carpetbagger"" or ""leper"".  https://i.imgur.com/Kfh7NiQ.png",newsflashjackass,1704981446,1,0,0,0

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less.

As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress.

If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

Also, you can not name a single person who really believes a woman should be able to have an abortion anytime, anywhere up to 9 months, like the right continues to lie about.

khd5q5r,politics,"In addition to the other comments, but being able to sell ammo to both the US military and civilians allows the plant to produce more. With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

So I’m very much “part of the problem” because I’m finding it extremely difficult to get out of public housing and am on a lot of it long term. Here’s why;  GOP has, to date, cut my food benefits by 98%, usually in line with my increases in pay for other programs. My gains cancel eachother out, if not cost me. In 2024 by benefits went up by $35, my food benefits went down by $32 and my meds started started costing me $20 a month. So there’s a an SSI “raise” of -$15.   My mom is elderly. She has to pay for Medicare. Her benefits went up by $54 and costs increased by $120. As a 75 year old. They sent literature suggesting we both get job training for a certificate in labor.  They’re just trying to starve us out of the system and then blame all of its problems on us like we’re over here sipping mai tais and eating filet on vacation in the Bahamas while working people suffer a Dickensian nightmare here.

Democrats pointed to how he blatantly accepted gifts by foreign governments directly, against direct law forbidding a president to do so, but Trump continues to push his ""invulnerability"" claim all the way to... Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress. The clause is intended to prevent corruption and foreign influence on the federal officials",DropsTheMic,1704982503,0,0,0,0

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival. If more people vote, they lose every time.",AtheistAustralis,1704982150,0,0,0,0

Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.

Trump famously did not, he just handed it off to his stooges and mumbled some platitudes for the camera. Nothing legally or practically changed when he assumed office, something Democrats glaringly pointed to. Democrats pointed to how he blatantly accepted gifts by foreign governments directly, against direct law forbidding a president to do so, but Trump continues to push his ""invulnerability"" claim all the way to... Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress.

If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival. If more people vote, they lose every time.",AtheistAustralis,1704982150,0,0,0,0
khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

Trump famously did not, he just handed it off to his stooges and mumbled some platitudes for the camera. Nothing legally or practically changed when he assumed office, something Democrats glaringly pointed to. Democrats pointed to how he blatantly accepted gifts by foreign governments directly, against direct law forbidding a president to do so, but Trump continues to push his ""invulnerability"" claim all the way to... Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress. The clause is intended to prevent corruption and foreign influence on the federal officials",DropsTheMic,1704982503,0,0,0,0

If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.  House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) [agreed last weekend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/07/congress-budget-deal/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) to rescind IRS funding as part of 2024 budget negotiations, although the deal must still pass Congress.

Trump famously did not, he just handed it off to his stooges and mumbled some platitudes for the camera.

Democrats pointed to how he blatantly accepted gifts by foreign governments directly, against direct law forbidding a president to do so, but Trump continues to push his ""invulnerability"" claim all the way to... Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress.

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.  House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) [agreed last weekend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/07/congress-budget-deal/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) to rescind IRS funding as part of 2024 budget negotiations, although the deal must still pass Congress. Instead of [the $80 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/06/inflation-reduction-act-irs/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) over 10 years granted as part of Biden’s landmark [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/08/07/senate-inflation-reduction-act-climate/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5), the IRS will get $60 billion, of which $25 billion will go toward tax enforcement.",washingtonpost,1704982530,0,0,0,0

Democrats pointed to how he blatantly accepted gifts by foreign governments directly, against direct law forbidding a president to do so, but Trump continues to push his ""invulnerability"" claim all the way to... Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival. If more people vote, they lose every time.",AtheistAustralis,1704982150,0,0,0,0

Democrats pointed to how he blatantly accepted gifts by foreign governments directly, against direct law forbidding a president to do so, but Trump continues to push his ""invulnerability"" claim all the way to... Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle.

Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

khd5q5r,politics,"In addition to the other comments, but being able to sell ammo to both the US military and civilians allows the plant to produce more. With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Trump famously did not, he just handed it off to his stooges and mumbled some platitudes for the camera.

Democrats pointed to how he blatantly accepted gifts by foreign governments directly, against direct law forbidding a president to do so, but Trump continues to push his ""invulnerability"" claim all the way to... Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.  House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) [agreed last weekend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/07/congress-budget-deal/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) to rescind IRS funding as part of 2024 budget negotiations, although the deal must still pass Congress. Instead of [the $80 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/06/inflation-reduction-act-irs/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) over 10 years granted as part of Biden’s landmark [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/08/07/senate-inflation-reduction-act-climate/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5), the IRS will get $60 billion, of which $25 billion will go toward tax enforcement.",washingtonpost,1704982530,0,0,0,0

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

There would be some of course, but given that Trump gained tons of votes between 2016 and 2020 it suggests those people are much smaller than the ones who support Trump.  >Not to mention the people in the center who vote most of the time for GOP, but not if GOP pushes a loony candidate like Trump  Just because you and I recognize Trump to be a nut job extremist doesn't mean swing voters do.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.  House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) [agreed last weekend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/07/congress-budget-deal/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) to rescind IRS funding as part of 2024 budget negotiations, although the deal must still pass Congress.

Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

khd5q5r,politics,"In addition to the other comments, but being able to sell ammo to both the US military and civilians allows the plant to produce more. With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

khd44lt,politics,"Because the President is required to divest himself of conflicts of interests prior to assuming office. Trump famously did not, he just handed it off to his stooges and mumbled some platitudes for the camera. Nothing legally or practically changed when he assumed office, something Democrats glaringly pointed to. Democrats pointed to how he blatantly accepted gifts by foreign governments directly, against direct law forbidding a president to do so, but Trump continues to push his ""invulnerability"" claim all the way to... Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress. The clause is intended to prevent corruption and foreign influence on the federal officials",DropsTheMic,1704982503,0,0,0,0

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

That threshold stands at $55,500 in annual income, according to the most recent USDA guidelines.   Free lunches are available to families with children who earn 130% of the federal poverty line.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Whatever that means.  I hope that in the future ""businessman"" gains the same stigma as ""carpetbagger"" or ""leper"".  https://i.imgur.com/Kfh7NiQ.png",newsflashjackass,1704981446,1,0,0,0

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.  House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) [agreed last weekend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/07/congress-budget-deal/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5) to rescind IRS funding as part of 2024 budget negotiations, although the deal must still pass Congress.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.

khd2nwt,politics,"This is not about healthcare.   Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment,  amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people.  Trump administration’s 2019 policy that would have stripped federal funding from health facilities thatl required workers to provide any service they objected to, such as abortions, contraception, gender-affirming care and sterilization.  Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0

Democrats pointed to how he blatantly accepted gifts by foreign governments directly, against direct law forbidding a president to do so, but Trump continues to push his ""invulnerability"" claim all the way to... Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress.

Here.  Which is why he is stupid. All of this, from the ground up, is in strict violation of his oath. He clearly doesn't give two shits about anything.  The oath of office that presidents swear to not accept gifts from foreign governments is related to the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause is a provision in Article I, Section 9, Clause 81 that prohibits the federal government from granting titles of nobility, and restricts members of the federal government from receiving gifts, emoluments, offices or titles from foreign states and monarchies without the consent of the United States Congress.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections. There's a very good reason why so much Republican campaign strategy is about suppressing voting, because they know it's their only chance of survival.

khd39p0,politics,"Want to hear a depressing statistic? Well I'll tell you anyway.  If every eligible voter that would likely vote Democrat voted in the 2020 election, Biden would have won *every state*. Even in states that Trump carried by 30 points, there were enough Democrat voters that stayed home to make up the difference. Let's look at a hugely red state like Alabama, that Trump won by 600,000 votes. But 1.4 *million* eligible voters didn't vote, and of those an estimated 650,000 would be likely Democrat voters. Turnout in the younger age demographics where more than half voted Democrat was *abysmal*, meaning that even though 2/3rds of voters voted for Trump, almost half of those who stayed home were likely Democrat voters.  Shit, even if *every* eligible voter actually voted, it would have been a landslide to Biden, all the battleground states would have been easily blue. The problem isn't lack of support in the population, the problem is voter turnout. Saying ""my vote doesn't matter because I'm in a red state"" is silly, because there are so many people in those states that just don't vote. If they all voted, things would be very, very different. And even if the winner wasn't changed, the final count would be a whole lot closer and it would force Republicans to either spend more money there, or (*gasp*) change their unpopular policies a little bit to try to win those voters and increase the margin.  Everybody needs to vote, in every single election. Then you wouldn't have a 30% minority of the country determining the outcome of elections.

With the increased scale of production they can produce the ammo with less costs and thus sell the ammo for less. Having more available and sold at cheaper prices reduces the costs across the board for the civilian market.   All that said I don’t like this solution to the problem of gun violence here. As a gun owner I’d like ammo to stay affordable, or at least as “affordable” as it currently is. I’d rather beef up background checks, require background checks and wait times for every gun sale, need a license to own them, and register them like I do my truck and motorcycle. Also wouldn’t be opposed to periodic mental health checks being a part of the requirements to have a license to own a gun. Also and different can of worms but better healthcare and mental healthcare access in general.   I get that that puts a few impediments on my right to own my guns, but not so many that it really restricts it. And it would likely help reduce gun violence overall, which everyone should want. I’d definitely like to keep using my guns to put meat on the table and never need them for self defense.

Not even two years later, Republicans in Congress have succeeded in clawing back $20 billion of the IRS’s new funding, and they may wipe out more, denting the administration’s vision for a revitalized tax agency.

Is pregnancy a disease? An illness? Injury? A physical it mental impairment? No. Therefore abortion/contraception is not healthcare.   Now do not get me wrong. The hospital I worked for would do emergency abortions to save the life of the mother and do emergency contraceptives in case rape. There is no need for us to do abortions/contraceptives otherwise. There are places i.e. planned parenthood that do that. Why do healthcare providers at the hospital need to be forced to do that to. We are here for emergency and critical care, we are not your PCP/Planned parenthood. Needing a routine abortion or contraceptives is not a emergency or critical in nature (with three obvious exception of life of the mother/rape).   I do not know anyone in the healthcare field that is against helping with an abortions for an ectopic pregnancy or placenta abruption ect. I don't know anyone in the healthcare field that is against contraceptives for post rape.  How about sterilization? Is it a disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments? Yeah no. Unless there is say cancer. But if it is cancer it is not a sterilization, but removal of cancer. Sterilization is a secondary effect not the purpose and no one would reject to that.   Gender affirming care? I don't know anyone that really cares unless it is a kid. Now before you say it is mental impairment and it's healthcare, let me say I don't disagree with you. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the DSM V. It is a mineral condition that requires healthcare.   But, the DSM V also states that Medical affirmation is not recommended for prepubertal children. Therefore the refusal to provide gender affirming medical care to these children is against healthcare standards per the DSM V.  TLDR: Healthcare is not a right unless it is an emergency/critical in nature. No healthcare providers are refusing abortions to save the mother or contraceptives to rape victims. Everything else listed is either not healthcare or providing the service goes against the DSM V treatment recommendations.",Zasaran,1704981899,0,0,0,0
