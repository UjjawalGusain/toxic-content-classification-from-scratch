khd7cd5,AskReddit,"Just because slavery is technically illegal in America, doesn't mean the economy is not dependent on practices that resemble slavery.   Part of what allows people to live so well in the west is importing cheaply made goods from countries with lax labour laws. Often the workers manufacturing these goods have few rights and work for starvation wages.   Many employers in America hire illegal immigrants, pay them less than minimum wage, put them up in a big house with a bunch of people in each room, deduct housing costs from their pay and threaten to deport them if they don't obey.  You could put your fingers in your ears and close your eyes and tell yourself these two groups of people do not resemble slaves if you want, but both of these groups of people are basically slaves and the modern American economy is dependent on them.",Vivid_Barracuda1246,1704983783,0,0,0,0

And then when Johnson plays himself dressing as Black Adam, and the whole fiasco behind the scenes with that movie after it came out, made me start to dislike him.

Keep in mind that Japan and Korea have a healthier cuisine than the US (most countries do, US food is a cholesterol festival and the US also serves notoriously big portions), which can also partly account for the fact that Japan and Korea have lower obesity rates.

We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

I would have believed her, but I hadn't had sex in over a year.  I have no idea what it was. My sister came over to look at it and she didn't know either. She took care of it for me.

khd6nvv,AskReddit,"Denefits.   If you go to the dentist and need major work, there are fliers for companies offering to pay the bill and you pay them back.  But if you take the deal, it's not a low interest. It's a cumulative 26% interest rate on the entire price of the loan, even if you have paid part of the loan off.  They get away with it, because its not a loan. A loan is you borrowing money, and the government provides you many protections as a borrower. It's the investing money in you. Because they are the investors, they are the one with the legal protection.  Let me say that again: because they invest money in you, they have legal protection instead of you.  This can easily double the cost of your dental bill. Or worse. Getting out by paying off early? There are early repayment penalties.  They get away with it because you get scammed for a thousand dollars on a five hundred dollar bill, you pay it and complain, but they still get their money.  We used their financing to pay for complete dental removal, all teeth, and full implants, a full set, and all follow up care. The interest was set to be $42,000+ on a $24,000 investment.   Whatever you have experienced with payday lenders, this is much nastier and sneakier. It's been a couple of years since we went through it, so I forget some of the loopholes they used, but it's the must brutal ""loan"" I've ever even heard about.   We were able to get out of it because I am military, I have good credit, and my bank, USAA, backed us against them when we argued, and gave me an unsecured loan to pay the whole thing off.   This company preys on you when you need an emergency extraction, or your child needs dental work you can't pay for, and then they ruthlessly fuck you.  I cannot express how bad they are.

khd6jt1,AskReddit,"Any movie that has a comedian actor/actress in a movie that is not about comedy instantly kills the vibes for me. Right now, that's Awkwafina. So far, she has been the most unfunny and annoying person in a lot of her recent works. Shang Chi and Little Mermaid were both movies where I found her incredibly annoying and unlikable. 
   
   Which is why I'm also nervous about her role in Kung Fu Panda 4. Yes, Kung fu panda is a movie that has pretty good comedy. But I'd argue that for the most part, that is simply because Jack Black is a very good and well-beloved actor. It also helps that Jack Black is actually very funny. Awkwafina, however, is not really any of those things. She is not really funny at all, and she is also not a very good actress.",SpiralGMG,1704983470,0,0,0,0

This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.  So it can be spun whatever way you like it... but it's shitty to ignore other people work being taken because of ""Robin is a real talent and we like him better"".

We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

khd6nvv,AskReddit,"Denefits.   If you go to the dentist and need major work, there are fliers for companies offering to pay the bill and you pay them back.  But if you take the deal, it's not a low interest. It's a cumulative 26% interest rate on the entire price of the loan, even if you have paid part of the loan off.  They get away with it, because its not a loan. A loan is you borrowing money, and the government provides you many protections as a borrower. It's the investing money in you. Because they are the investors, they are the one with the legal protection.  Let me say that again: because they invest money in you, they have legal protection instead of you.  This can easily double the cost of your dental bill. Or worse. Getting out by paying off early? There are early repayment penalties.  They get away with it because you get scammed for a thousand dollars on a five hundred dollar bill, you pay it and complain, but they still get their money.  We used their financing to pay for complete dental removal, all teeth, and full implants, a full set, and all follow up care. The interest was set to be $42,000+ on a $24,000 investment.   Whatever you have experienced with payday lenders, this is much nastier and sneakier. It's been a couple of years since we went through it, so I forget some of the loopholes they used, but it's the must brutal ""loan"" I've ever even heard about.   We were able to get out of it because I am military, I have good credit, and my bank, USAA, backed us against them when we argued, and gave me an unsecured loan to pay the whole thing off.   This company preys on you when you need an emergency extraction, or your child needs dental work you can't pay for, and then they ruthlessly fuck you.  I cannot express how bad they are.

khd7gxz,AskReddit,"Oh yeah. My son went through a colic phase. Fortunately it wasn’t as bad as some others I’ve heard of. He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”. So now if I’m sleep deprived it’s because I make poor choices for myself, but there’s a reason we’re a one and done family.

khd7gxz,AskReddit,"Oh yeah. My son went through a colic phase. Fortunately it wasn’t as bad as some others I’ve heard of. He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”. So now if I’m sleep deprived it’s because I make poor choices for myself, but there’s a reason we’re a one and done family.

But its kinda like asking ""are you dumb?"" technically its not directly an insult, but you should know that how its taken.  i can understand how one may take it as an insult if you're defensive about such associations. It's not the default reaction, imo.  I can say 'that is incel tier language' and the person could have no association with them, or fear of being associated with them, and react with 'wow, really? how so?'. then a dicussion can follow where it's explained. They are now more aware of what the idea conveys.  myself, i was raised in a racist community and have since made huge efforts to separate my upbringing from who i want to be. I didnt' think of myself as racist, and i would use terms like 'the blacks' thinking it was an acceptable alternative to the n-word. when i got called out on it, i genuinely didn't know it was language normally used by racists people.

As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

Those parents will be punishing themselves harder than a jail cell ever could for the rest of their lives.  It's not negligence because the parent was playing Candy Crush on their phone and left the kid in the car. Or the case of the grandmother, [Tracey Nix](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/florida-woman-manslaughter-hot-car-b2310613.html), who had it happen *twice* to the same son and daughter-in-law's kids while she was babysitting and they died. Those cases should be assessed for what they are.   But I can't judge a parent who leaves their kid in the car accidentally after a grocery trip, for example, and never had any prior major lapses, because it's such a horrific circumstance that I can't even imagine. I wouldn't want to be the prosecutor in a case where I had to decide whether to charge a parent who lost a child that way, that's for sure.",LisbethsSalamander,1704983849,0,0,0,0

And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.

My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.

As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

I was always just told he did “consulting.” He went to law school but never actually practiced law, was (and remains) very physically fit and is, to use a weird term for a real person, a very dashing guy, appearance-wise.   A few years ago he was in a bizarre car accident which involved another driver plowing into his car at a stoplight; he was relatively unhurt but the car was totaled and they needed to cut him out of it. The other driver was arrested immediately at the scene because- and this is the really weird part to me- the cars immediately in front of AND behind him were unmarked police vehicles being driven by plainclothes cops. There was no local media coverage of the incident (it occurred at a major thoroughfare in a midsize American city) and nobody in my family ever heard what happened to the guy who hit him.   I am convinced, down to my bones, that my uncle spent the 90s as some sort of secret agent and his “car accident” was someone trying to take him out for it.",throwaway18911090,1704983854,0,0,0,0

And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

khd762a,AskReddit,">he couldn't differ between what he thought of or what he heard somewhere.  Which to other comedians is stealing material.  Like many comedians have discussed on podcasts about how if Robin was in a room while you did your sets, parts of your sets would get ""repurposed"" by Robin which was a bigger name and burns the material you came up with, as the smaller comic looks like the thief after Robin does it.  In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.  So it can be spun whatever way you like it... but it's shitty to ignore other people work being taken because of ""Robin is a real talent and we like him better"".  I like Robin Williams as an actor etc.  I can easily see how many in the industry have mixed feeling when he stole parts of their acts regardless of his intent and they could not get away with doing the same because they were not ""as big"" as Robin Willams.",SkullRunner,1704983713,0,0,0,0

khd6se2,AskReddit,"One explanation that's actually rather boring is that we don't have very good ways of detecting life, and that life may very well be rare enough that most instances of life will appear so far from one another (spatially or temporally) that they'll almost never interact.  We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter. Even in a universe where there isn't one, life may simply just be that rare to explain our observations.",Shazoa,1704983565,0,0,0,0

khd6nvv,AskReddit,"Denefits.   If you go to the dentist and need major work, there are fliers for companies offering to pay the bill and you pay them back.  But if you take the deal, it's not a low interest. It's a cumulative 26% interest rate on the entire price of the loan, even if you have paid part of the loan off.  They get away with it, because its not a loan. A loan is you borrowing money, and the government provides you many protections as a borrower. It's the investing money in you. Because they are the investors, they are the one with the legal protection.  Let me say that again: because they invest money in you, they have legal protection instead of you.  This can easily double the cost of your dental bill. Or worse. Getting out by paying off early? There are early repayment penalties.  They get away with it because you get scammed for a thousand dollars on a five hundred dollar bill, you pay it and complain, but they still get their money.  We used their financing to pay for complete dental removal, all teeth, and full implants, a full set, and all follow up care. The interest was set to be $42,000+ on a $24,000 investment.   Whatever you have experienced with payday lenders, this is much nastier and sneakier. It's been a couple of years since we went through it, so I forget some of the loopholes they used, but it's the must brutal ""loan"" I've ever even heard about.

A few years ago he was in a bizarre car accident which involved another driver plowing into his car at a stoplight; he was relatively unhurt but the car was totaled and they needed to cut him out of it.

khd7gxz,AskReddit,"Oh yeah. My son went through a colic phase. Fortunately it wasn’t as bad as some others I’ve heard of. He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”. So now if I’m sleep deprived it’s because I make poor choices for myself, but there’s a reason we’re a one and done family.

It's not the default reaction, imo.

They are now more aware of what the idea conveys.  myself, i was raised in a racist community and have since made huge efforts to separate my upbringing from who i want to be. I didnt' think of myself as racist, and i would use terms like 'the blacks' thinking it was an acceptable alternative to the n-word. when i got called out on it, i genuinely didn't know it was language normally used by racists people.

The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.

khd7f6g,AskReddit,"This is true in IT office work. Skills or not, if youre older and have the skills, you cost more than the younger who has skills and not worth it to the company long-term.  You and your higher salary will be the first to go or the first with your salary cut.   And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

khd7dte,AskReddit,"Possibly not.  As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.

They were freaking out about resourcing, physician availability, pushing for my portfolio of online booking and virtual care solutions to be launched immediately to all of our physician users nationally for free. It was so blatant I did some reasonable pandemic shopping and got ready to hunker down by March 1. My husband thought I was nuts.

We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter. Even in a universe where there isn't one, life may simply just be that rare to explain our observations.",Shazoa,1704983565,0,0,0,0

khd6nvv,AskReddit,"Denefits.   If you go to the dentist and need major work, there are fliers for companies offering to pay the bill and you pay them back.  But if you take the deal, it's not a low interest. It's a cumulative 26% interest rate on the entire price of the loan, even if you have paid part of the loan off.  They get away with it, because its not a loan. A loan is you borrowing money, and the government provides you many protections as a borrower. It's the investing money in you. Because they are the investors, they are the one with the legal protection.  Let me say that again: because they invest money in you, they have legal protection instead of you.  This can easily double the cost of your dental bill. Or worse. Getting out by paying off early? There are early repayment penalties.  They get away with it because you get scammed for a thousand dollars on a five hundred dollar bill, you pay it and complain, but they still get their money.  We used their financing to pay for complete dental removal, all teeth, and full implants, a full set, and all follow up care. The interest was set to be $42,000+ on a $24,000 investment.   Whatever you have experienced with payday lenders, this is much nastier and sneakier. It's been a couple of years since we went through it, so I forget some of the loopholes they used, but it's the must brutal ""loan"" I've ever even heard about.   We were able to get out of it because I am military, I have good credit, and my bank, USAA, backed us against them when we argued, and gave me an unsecured loan to pay the whole thing off.   This company preys on you when you need an emergency extraction, or your child needs dental work you can't pay for, and then they ruthlessly fuck you.  I cannot express how bad they are. Put your dental bill on a 29% interest credit card, you will be better off.",111110001011,1704983516,0,0,0,0

Lifting weights in the gym will increase muscle mass - and potentially increase your weight - but it isn’t the most efficient method of losing weight.  5 miles at 15 stones is roughly 750 calories per day (it’s ~10 calories/mile/stone of body weight). 3500 calories is roughly 1lb of fat. Cycling is roughly 1/3 the calories/mile (but you can go further/faster), and swimming around 500/mile.  Lifting weights will increase muscle mass, but won’t burn anything like that amount of energy - roughly 100-200 calories depending on body weight and workout volume.",DaveBeBad,1704983490,0,0,0,0

And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

khd7dte,AskReddit,"Possibly not.  As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.

The reason may be that a different manager 2 levels up may be chasing different hiring metrics and not in communication with other people managers. They hire to make their numbers look good so they hit their bonus and don’t give a shit about anything else. They think they need people. But if they had been listening to their team all along, they could have seen that the layoffs were coming and held back in hiring. Instead, HR does all the onboarding and then layoffs.",OPsMomHuffsFartJars,1704983676,0,0,0,0

We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

khd7gxz,AskReddit,"Oh yeah. My son went through a colic phase. Fortunately it wasn’t as bad as some others I’ve heard of. He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”. So now if I’m sleep deprived it’s because I make poor choices for myself, but there’s a reason we’re a one and done family.

But its kinda like asking ""are you dumb?"" technically its not directly an insult, but you should know that how its taken.  i can understand how one may take it as an insult if you're defensive about such associations. It's not the default reaction, imo.  I can say 'that is incel tier language' and the person could have no association with them, or fear of being associated with them, and react with 'wow, really? how so?'. then a dicussion can follow where it's explained. They are now more aware of what the idea conveys.  myself, i was raised in a racist community and have since made huge efforts to separate my upbringing from who i want to be. I didnt' think of myself as racist, and i would use terms like 'the blacks' thinking it was an acceptable alternative to the n-word. when i got called out on it, i genuinely didn't know it was language normally used by racists people. Instead of denial, or bringing up many other topics that surround it, i asked why it was racist language.

Part of what allows people to live so well in the west is importing cheaply made goods from countries with lax labour laws. Often the workers manufacturing these goods have few rights and work for starvation wages.   Many employers in America hire illegal immigrants, pay them less than minimum wage, put them up in a big house with a bunch of people in each room, deduct housing costs from their pay and threaten to deport them if they don't obey.  You could put your fingers in your ears and close your eyes and tell yourself these two groups of people do not resemble slaves if you want, but both of these groups of people are basically slaves and the modern American economy is dependent on them.",Vivid_Barracuda1246,1704983783,0,0,0,0

Like many comedians have discussed on podcasts about how if Robin was in a room while you did your sets, parts of your sets would get ""repurposed"" by Robin which was a bigger name and burns the material you came up with, as the smaller comic looks like the thief after Robin does it.  In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.  So it can be spun whatever way you like it... but it's shitty to ignore other people work being taken because of ""Robin is a real talent and we like him better"".  I like Robin Williams as an actor etc.  I can easily see how many in the industry have mixed feeling when he stole parts of their acts regardless of his intent and they could not get away with doing the same because they were not ""as big"" as Robin Willams.",SkullRunner,1704983713,0,0,0,0

Everyone knows some nearby town (if not their own town) that has to keep trying to raise taxes while cutting services because they can't afford to sustain them anymore. It's why a lot of these places outsource their EMS, police, garbage collection, etc to nearby towns.  People usually want to blame corruption or the ineptitude of the current local government, but it's literally your built environment (which is technically the fault of former governments, but still it's not because some new guy came in and took all the money for himself).

khd7oaq,AskReddit,"It wasn't just the inflatable tanks. It was a whole deception operation, Operation Body Gaurd. It was a fake fleet of planes, a fake force of men (First US Army Group aka FUSAG). This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais. So much so that he kept the entire German 15th army in Calais for an additional 7 weeks, allowing the allies vital time to build up a beachhead.",skrilledcheese,1704983913,0,0,0,0

If a politician is being pragmatic and saying we should legalize drug use under a regulated system, rather than making it illegal, their opponent will go to the constituents and say that guy wants to sell your kids drugs!  I think a similar argument can be made for prostitution. Although with drugs you're only really harming yourself, with prostitution there's still potential for abuse even under a regulated system.",unlikelypisces,1704983870,0,0,0,0

khd7f6g,AskReddit,"This is true in IT office work. Skills or not, if youre older and have the skills, you cost more than the younger who has skills and not worth it to the company long-term.  You and your higher salary will be the first to go or the first with your salary cut.   And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around.

As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

And then when Johnson plays himself dressing as Black Adam, and the whole fiasco behind the scenes with that movie after it came out, made me start to dislike him. And then in the years leasing to now, he's pretty much extremely shallow product instead of a person. It's why he'll never be Arnold, even if Arnold is typecasted.",SengalBoy,1704983698,0,0,0,0

They saw women driving and got their license numbers and compiled complete dossiers on them.  They listened to phone calls they had no business listening to.  This happened *thousands* of times.

They didn't go to prison, they didn't get arrested, they didn't even get fired.  The CIA actively engaged in torture.  A number of the victims of CIA torture have come forward.

This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais. So much so that he kept the entire German 15th army in Calais for an additional 7 weeks, allowing the allies vital time to build up a beachhead.",skrilledcheese,1704983913,0,0,0,0

A few years ago he was in a bizarre car accident which involved another driver plowing into his car at a stoplight; he was relatively unhurt but the car was totaled and they needed to cut him out of it. The other driver was arrested immediately at the scene because- and this is the really weird part to me- the cars immediately in front of AND behind him were unmarked police vehicles being driven by plainclothes cops. There was no local media coverage of the incident (it occurred at a major thoroughfare in a midsize American city) and nobody in my family ever heard what happened to the guy who hit him.

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”.

This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

khd7f6g,AskReddit,"This is true in IT office work. Skills or not, if youre older and have the skills, you cost more than the younger who has skills and not worth it to the company long-term.  You and your higher salary will be the first to go or the first with your salary cut.   And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

And rest for awhile in the warm summer sun   I've been walking all day, and I'm nearly done   And I see by your gravestone you were only nineteen   When you joined the glorious fallen in 1916   Well, I hope you died quick and I hope you died clean   Or, Willam McBride, was it slow and obscene?   Chorus:   Did they beat the drum slowly?   Did they sound the pipe lowly?   Did the rifles fire o'er you as they lowered you down?   Did the bugles sing ""The Last Post"" in chorus?   Did the pipes play ""The Flowers of the Forest""?   And did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind?   In some loyal heart is your memory enshrined?   And though you died back in 1916   To that faithful heart are you always nineteen?   Or are you just a stranger without even a name   Forever enclosed behind some glass pane   In an old photograph, torn and tattered and stained   And fading to yellow in a brown leather frame?   Chorus:   Did they beat the drum slowly?   Did they sound the pipe lowly?   Did the rifles fire o'er you as they lowered you down?   Did the bugles sing ""The Last Post"" in chorus?

This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais. So much so that he kept the entire German 15th army in Calais for an additional 7 weeks, allowing the allies vital time to build up a beachhead.",skrilledcheese,1704983913,0,0,0,0

I was always just told he did “consulting.” He went to law school but never actually practiced law, was (and remains) very physically fit and is, to use a weird term for a real person, a very dashing guy, appearance-wise.   A few years ago he was in a bizarre car accident which involved another driver plowing into his car at a stoplight; he was relatively unhurt but the car was totaled and they needed to cut him out of it. The other driver was arrested immediately at the scene because- and this is the really weird part to me- the cars immediately in front of AND behind him were unmarked police vehicles being driven by plainclothes cops. There was no local media coverage of the incident (it occurred at a major thoroughfare in a midsize American city) and nobody in my family ever heard what happened to the guy who hit him.   I am convinced, down to my bones, that my uncle spent the 90s as some sort of secret agent and his “car accident” was someone trying to take him out for it.",throwaway18911090,1704983854,0,0,0,0

And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”. So now if I’m sleep deprived it’s because I make poor choices for myself, but there’s a reason we’re a one and done family.

khd7dte,AskReddit,"Possibly not.  As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.

Like many comedians have discussed on podcasts about how if Robin was in a room while you did your sets, parts of your sets would get ""repurposed"" by Robin which was a bigger name and burns the material you came up with, as the smaller comic looks like the thief after Robin does it.  In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.  So it can be spun whatever way you like it... but it's shitty to ignore other people work being taken because of ""Robin is a real talent and we like him better"".

khd7vsn,AskReddit,"The thing is the difference between a ‘healthy bmi’ compared to an ‘obese bmi’ can be as little as a few extra 100 calories per day. For example, a woman my height (5’9) who is sedentary and weighs 220 pounds (so class 1 obese) requires 2100ish calories each day to maintain this weight. For a woman same height but weighing 160 pounds (a healthy bmi), you need to eat 1830ish a day to maintain. That is a difference of 2-300 calories. Like two extra slices of bread a day, or a few tablespoons of olive oil.  This is why the stereotypes of the gluttonous overweight person who eats everything in sight and the skinny person is who lives off cabbage soup and air doesn’t actually apply to most people. The vast majority of ‘naturally skinny’ people that I know are generally not habitual overeaters. But they also don’t starve themselves or eat accordingly to all the odd rules you might find from googling ‘how thin people eat.’ Most of that stuff is diet culture nonsense designed to make weight management and weight loss seem complicated and impossible.  Everyone is different ofcourse but the general rule of thumb is that overweight people regularly ate beyond the maintenance amount of calories needed for a healthy weight at their height. Some overweight people struggle with binge eating or emotional eating or generally having bigger appetites and cultural and family influences/ general ignorance about nutrition. And thin people ate within their maintenance, either because they are conscious about calories and nutrition or simply because of their cultural/family influences and general smaller appetite or lack of interest in food. I personally don’t subscribe to the idea of thin people and overweight people being massively genetically predetermined or victims of fate. It’s all about small seemingly insignificant choices over time.",Kaden0339,1704983993,0,0,0,0

This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais. So much so that he kept the entire German 15th army in Calais for an additional 7 weeks, allowing the allies vital time to build up a beachhead.",skrilledcheese,1704983913,0,0,0,0

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”.

It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.

khd7dte,AskReddit,"Possibly not.  As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

khd7f6g,AskReddit,"This is true in IT office work. Skills or not, if youre older and have the skills, you cost more than the younger who has skills and not worth it to the company long-term.  You and your higher salary will be the first to go or the first with your salary cut.   And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.  So it can be spun whatever way you like it... but it's shitty to ignore other people work being taken because of ""Robin is a real talent and we like him better"".

khd7vsn,AskReddit,"The thing is the difference between a ‘healthy bmi’ compared to an ‘obese bmi’ can be as little as a few extra 100 calories per day. For example, a woman my height (5’9) who is sedentary and weighs 220 pounds (so class 1 obese) requires 2100ish calories each day to maintain this weight. For a woman same height but weighing 160 pounds (a healthy bmi), you need to eat 1830ish a day to maintain. That is a difference of 2-300 calories. Like two extra slices of bread a day, or a few tablespoons of olive oil.  This is why the stereotypes of the gluttonous overweight person who eats everything in sight and the skinny person is who lives off cabbage soup and air doesn’t actually apply to most people. The vast majority of ‘naturally skinny’ people that I know are generally not habitual overeaters. But they also don’t starve themselves or eat accordingly to all the odd rules you might find from googling ‘how thin people eat.’ Most of that stuff is diet culture nonsense designed to make weight management and weight loss seem complicated and impossible.  Everyone is different ofcourse but the general rule of thumb is that overweight people regularly ate beyond the maintenance amount of calories needed for a healthy weight at their height. Some overweight people struggle with binge eating or emotional eating or generally having bigger appetites and cultural and family influences/ general ignorance about nutrition. And thin people ate within their maintenance, either because they are conscious about calories and nutrition or simply because of their cultural/family influences and general smaller appetite or lack of interest in food. I personally don’t subscribe to the idea of thin people and overweight people being massively genetically predetermined or victims of fate. It’s all about small seemingly insignificant choices over time.",Kaden0339,1704983993,0,0,0,0

And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

khd6nvv,AskReddit,"Denefits.   If you go to the dentist and need major work, there are fliers for companies offering to pay the bill and you pay them back.  But if you take the deal, it's not a low interest. It's a cumulative 26% interest rate on the entire price of the loan, even if you have paid part of the loan off.  They get away with it, because its not a loan. A loan is you borrowing money, and the government provides you many protections as a borrower. It's the investing money in you. Because they are the investors, they are the one with the legal protection.  Let me say that again: because they invest money in you, they have legal protection instead of you.  This can easily double the cost of your dental bill. Or worse. Getting out by paying off early? There are early repayment penalties.  They get away with it because you get scammed for a thousand dollars on a five hundred dollar bill, you pay it and complain, but they still get their money.  We used their financing to pay for complete dental removal, all teeth, and full implants, a full set, and all follow up care. The interest was set to be $42,000+ on a $24,000 investment.   Whatever you have experienced with payday lenders, this is much nastier and sneakier. It's been a couple of years since we went through it, so I forget some of the loopholes they used, but it's the must brutal ""loan"" I've ever even heard about.   We were able to get out of it because I am military, I have good credit, and my bank, USAA, backed us against them when we argued, and gave me an unsecured loan to pay the whole thing off.   This company preys on you when you need an emergency extraction, or your child needs dental work you can't pay for, and then they ruthlessly fuck you.  I cannot express how bad they are. Put your dental bill on a 29% interest credit card, you will be better off.",111110001011,1704983516,0,0,0,0

Many employers in America hire illegal immigrants, pay them less than minimum wage, put them up in a big house with a bunch of people in each room, deduct housing costs from their pay and threaten to deport them if they don't obey.

Keep in mind that Japan and Korea have a healthier cuisine than the US (most countries do, US food is a cholesterol festival and the US also serves notoriously big portions), which can also partly account for the fact that Japan and Korea have lower obesity rates.

We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”. So now if I’m sleep deprived it’s because I make poor choices for myself, but there’s a reason we’re a one and done family.

As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

Since they are opinion based, i am not disagreeing with them, because that would be pointless. Pointing out what they are, though, does make any discussion about it's validity not necessary.  > How do you define gender?  me? it's a culturally recognized identity, which varies across geographical locations, cultures, demographics, and time periods.  There are sub categories of culturally recognized identities, which include man, woman, variations of the two on a spectrum, mixed gender, two-spirited, Muxe, Māhū, nádleehí, Ashtime, Chibados, Palao'ana, people considered to be neither man nor woman, Bakla, and so many more that would be ridiculous to list all here.  > or Incel?  my definition? an Incel, or involuntarily celebate, is someone who cannot engage in sexual activities with others. The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.  They are toxic, self-proclaimed-victims, slut shaming, never taking responsibility for their own behavior, selfish, spoiled, and narrow minded group that are very vocal about their twisted beliefs.  > I would have to ask you about how you define words aswell, by your logic.  words? they're ideas expressed by vocal, or written, mediums which symbolize ideas which have been generally unified in understanding over time, and then organized in a way to promote uniformity. but, pictures and gestures can be 'words' too (ie. pictographs & sign language)  1 of 2 (cont'd)",wisedoormat,1704983799,0,0,0,0

khd6se2,AskReddit,"One explanation that's actually rather boring is that we don't have very good ways of detecting life, and that life may very well be rare enough that most instances of life will appear so far from one another (spatially or temporally) that they'll almost never interact.  We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

khd7gxz,AskReddit,"Oh yeah. My son went through a colic phase. Fortunately it wasn’t as bad as some others I’ve heard of. He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”. So now if I’m sleep deprived it’s because I make poor choices for myself, but there’s a reason we’re a one and done family.

As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

Since they are opinion based, i am not disagreeing with them, because that would be pointless. Pointing out what they are, though, does make any discussion about it's validity not necessary.  > How do you define gender?  me? it's a culturally recognized identity, which varies across geographical locations, cultures, demographics, and time periods.  There are sub categories of culturally recognized identities, which include man, woman, variations of the two on a spectrum, mixed gender, two-spirited, Muxe, Māhū, nádleehí, Ashtime, Chibados, Palao'ana, people considered to be neither man nor woman, Bakla, and so many more that would be ridiculous to list all here.  > or Incel?  my definition? an Incel, or involuntarily celebate, is someone who cannot engage in sexual activities with others. The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.  They are toxic, self-proclaimed-victims, slut shaming, never taking responsibility for their own behavior, selfish, spoiled, and narrow minded group that are very vocal about their twisted beliefs.  > I would have to ask you about how you define words aswell, by your logic.  words? they're ideas expressed by vocal, or written, mediums which symbolize ideas which have been generally unified in understanding over time, and then organized in a way to promote uniformity. but, pictures and gestures can be 'words' too (ie. pictographs & sign language)  1 of 2 (cont'd)",wisedoormat,1704983799,0,0,0,0

And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

Then Red Notice came along and everyone started to see how the three leads feels less like actors and just themselves, and not in a good way.  And then when Johnson plays himself dressing as Black Adam, and the whole fiasco behind the scenes with that movie after it came out, made me start to dislike him. And then in the years leasing to now, he's pretty much extremely shallow product instead of a person. It's why he'll never be Arnold, even if Arnold is typecasted.",SengalBoy,1704983698,0,0,0,0

But if they had been listening to their team all along, they could have seen that the layoffs were coming and held back in hiring.

In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.  So it can be spun whatever way you like it... but it's shitty to ignore other people work being taken because of ""Robin is a real talent and we like him better"".

khd7oaq,AskReddit,"It wasn't just the inflatable tanks. It was a whole deception operation, Operation Body Gaurd. It was a fake fleet of planes, a fake force of men (First US Army Group aka FUSAG). This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais. So much so that he kept the entire geeman 15th army in Calais for an additional 7 weeks.",skrilledcheese,1704983913,0,0,0,0

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”.

Since they are opinion based, i am not disagreeing with them, because that would be pointless. Pointing out what they are, though, does make any discussion about it's validity not necessary.  > How do you define gender?  me? it's a culturally recognized identity, which varies across geographical locations, cultures, demographics, and time periods.  There are sub categories of culturally recognized identities, which include man, woman, variations of the two on a spectrum, mixed gender, two-spirited, Muxe, Māhū, nádleehí, Ashtime, Chibados, Palao'ana, people considered to be neither man nor woman, Bakla, and so many more that would be ridiculous to list all here.  > or Incel?  my definition? an Incel, or involuntarily celebate, is someone who cannot engage in sexual activities with others. The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.  They are toxic, self-proclaimed-victims, slut shaming, never taking responsibility for their own behavior, selfish, spoiled, and narrow minded group that are very vocal about their twisted beliefs.  > I would have to ask you about how you define words aswell, by your logic.  words? they're ideas expressed by vocal, or written, mediums which symbolize ideas which have been generally unified in understanding over time, and then organized in a way to promote uniformity. but, pictures and gestures can be 'words' too (ie. pictographs & sign language)  1 of 2 (cont'd)",wisedoormat,1704983799,0,0,0,0

khd74ly,AskReddit,"I started seeing some cracks from Hobbs and Shaw. Where somehow, he feels like less Hobbs andore like The Rock™ the brand. I know Hobbs isn't deep in any way lol but him and that movie just feels somehow different than previous F&F movies, and not just because of the lack of goatee.  Then Red Notice came along and everyone started to see how the three leads feels less like actors and just themselves, and not in a good way.  And then when Johnson plays himself dressing as Black Adam, and the whole fiasco behind the scenes with that movie after it came out, made me start to dislike him. And then in the years leasing to now, he's pretty much extremely shallow product instead of a person. It's why he'll never be Arnold, even if Arnold is typecasted.",SengalBoy,1704983698,0,0,0,0

The same thing happened during the peak of the cold war, upticks in UFO sightings etc, and while some of it was likely genuine sightings of aircraft in testing etc I think a huge chunk of it was propaganda to scare foreign governments, particularly a lot of the ""it did [x and y] that defied physics / it moved faster than any aircraft I've ever seen before!"" type sightings.

I was always just told he did “consulting.” He went to law school but never actually practiced law, was (and remains) very physically fit and is, to use a weird term for a real person, a very dashing guy, appearance-wise.   A few years ago he was in a bizarre car accident which involved another driver plowing into his car at a stoplight; he was relatively unhurt but the car was totaled and they needed to cut him out of it. The other driver was arrested immediately at the scene because- and this is the really weird part to me- the cars immediately in front of AND behind him were unmarked police vehicles being driven by plainclothes cops. There was no local media coverage of the incident (it occurred at a major thoroughfare in a midsize American city) and nobody in my family ever heard what happened to the guy who hit him.   I am convinced, down to my bones, that my uncle spent the 90s as some sort of secret agent and his “car accident” was someone trying to take him out for it.",throwaway18911090,1704983854,0,0,0,0

khd7gxz,AskReddit,"Oh yeah. My son went through a colic phase. Fortunately it wasn’t as bad as some others I’ve heard of. He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”. So now if I’m sleep deprived it’s because I make poor choices for myself, but there’s a reason we’re a one and done family.

khd7dte,AskReddit,"Possibly not.  As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

Since they are opinion based, i am not disagreeing with them, because that would be pointless. Pointing out what they are, though, does make any discussion about it's validity not necessary.  > How do you define gender?  me? it's a culturally recognized identity, which varies across geographical locations, cultures, demographics, and time periods.  There are sub categories of culturally recognized identities, which include man, woman, variations of the two on a spectrum, mixed gender, two-spirited, Muxe, Māhū, nádleehí, Ashtime, Chibados, Palao'ana, people considered to be neither man nor woman, Bakla, and so many more that would be ridiculous to list all here.  > or Incel?  my definition? an Incel, or involuntarily celebate, is someone who cannot engage in sexual activities with others. The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.  They are toxic, self-proclaimed-victims, slut shaming, never taking responsibility for their own behavior, selfish, spoiled, and narrow minded group that are very vocal about their twisted beliefs.  > I would have to ask you about how you define words aswell, by your logic.  words? they're ideas expressed by vocal, or written, mediums which symbolize ideas which have been generally unified in understanding over time, and then organized in a way to promote uniformity. but, pictures and gestures can be 'words' too (ie. pictographs & sign language)  1 of 2 (cont'd)",wisedoormat,1704983799,0,0,0,0

khd7oaq,AskReddit,"It wasn't just the inflatable tanks. It was a whole deception operation, Operation Body Gaurd. It was a fake fleet of planes, a fake force of men (First US Army Group aka FUSAG). This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais. So much so that he kept the entire German 15th army in Calais for an additional 7 weeks, allowing the allies vital time to build up a beachhead.",skrilledcheese,1704983913,0,0,0,0

Then Red Notice came along and everyone started to see how the three leads feels less like actors and just themselves, and not in a good way.  And then when Johnson plays himself dressing as Black Adam, and the whole fiasco behind the scenes with that movie after it came out, made me start to dislike him. And then in the years leasing to now, he's pretty much extremely shallow product instead of a person. It's why he'll never be Arnold, even if Arnold is typecasted.",SengalBoy,1704983698,0,0,0,0

In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.  So it can be spun whatever way you like it... but it's shitty to ignore other people work being taken because of ""Robin is a real talent and we like him better"".

khd70ak,AskReddit,"America's suburbs and the vast majority of neighborhoods and towns built since World War II are completely unsustainable and are barreling towards eventual insolvency if they don't reverse course and go back to more traditional, sustainable forms of development.   You can see it happening already. Everyone knows some nearby town (if not their own town) that has to keep trying to raise taxes while cutting services because they can't afford to sustain them anymore. It's why a lot of these places outsource their EMS, police, garbage collection, etc to nearby towns.  People usually want to blame corruption or the ineptitude of the current local government, but it's literally your built environment (which is technically the fault of former governments, but still it's not because some new guy came in and took all the money for himself).

She decided to become a teacher so she could have summers off. She had zero teaching experience. Started off as a substitute teacher for a while and transitioned to becoming full time teacher. Happened within one year time. All these “underpaid” jobs will start paying more when there is a shortage of people to fill these jobs.

The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.

My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.

khd7dte,AskReddit,"Possibly not.  As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

It's not the default reaction, imo.

khd7oaq,AskReddit,"It wasn't just the inflatable tanks. It was a whole deception operation, Operation Body Gaurd. It was a fake fleet of planes, a fake force of men (First US Army Group aka FUSAG). This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais. So much so that he kept the entire geeman 15th army in Calais for an additional 7 weeks.",skrilledcheese,1704983913,0,0,0,0

We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”.

You and your higher salary will be the first to go or the first with your salary cut.   And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.   I watched them do this to people there for over 18 years.   Unions would have helped this ageism from happening.",mrPhildoToYou,1704983813,0,0,0,0

Since they are opinion based, i am not disagreeing with them, because that would be pointless. Pointing out what they are, though, does make any discussion about it's validity not necessary.  > How do you define gender?  me? it's a culturally recognized identity, which varies across geographical locations, cultures, demographics, and time periods.  There are sub categories of culturally recognized identities, which include man, woman, variations of the two on a spectrum, mixed gender, two-spirited, Muxe, Māhū, nádleehí, Ashtime, Chibados, Palao'ana, people considered to be neither man nor woman, Bakla, and so many more that would be ridiculous to list all here.  > or Incel?  my definition? an Incel, or involuntarily celebate, is someone who cannot engage in sexual activities with others. The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.  They are toxic, self-proclaimed-victims, slut shaming, never taking responsibility for their own behavior, selfish, spoiled, and narrow minded group that are very vocal about their twisted beliefs.  > I would have to ask you about how you define words aswell, by your logic.  words? they're ideas expressed by vocal, or written, mediums which symbolize ideas which have been generally unified in understanding over time, and then organized in a way to promote uniformity. but, pictures and gestures can be 'words' too (ie. pictographs & sign language)  1 of 2 (cont'd)",wisedoormat,1704983799,0,0,0,0

As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

Those cases should be assessed for what they are.

As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

khd6zbi,AskReddit,"The body positivity movement is a recent development. I would argue that until recently, the US was a country that loved body shaming (look at the 2000s obsession with diet culture) and yet even back then the US had a very high obesity rate.   Keep in mind that Japan and Korea have a healthier cuisine than the US (most countries do, US food is a cholesterol festival and the US also serves notoriously big portions), which can also partly account for the fact that Japan and Korea have lower obesity rates.   Lots of different factors need to taken into account when comparing obesity rates, but basically all research into the effect of body shaming specifically shows the same conclusion.",guccipecorino,1704983639,0,0,0,0

This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais. So much so that he kept the entire German 15th army in Calais for an additional 7 weeks, allowing the allies vital time to build up a beachhead.",skrilledcheese,1704983913,0,0,0,0

khd7dte,AskReddit,"Possibly not.  As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”.

You and your higher salary will be the first to go or the first with your salary cut.   And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

Since they are opinion based, i am not disagreeing with them, because that would be pointless. Pointing out what they are, though, does make any discussion about it's validity not necessary.  > How do you define gender?  me? it's a culturally recognized identity, which varies across geographical locations, cultures, demographics, and time periods.  There are sub categories of culturally recognized identities, which include man, woman, variations of the two on a spectrum, mixed gender, two-spirited, Muxe, Māhū, nádleehí, Ashtime, Chibados, Palao'ana, people considered to be neither man nor woman, Bakla, and so many more that would be ridiculous to list all here.  > or Incel?  my definition? an Incel, or involuntarily celebate, is someone who cannot engage in sexual activities with others. The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.  They are toxic, self-proclaimed-victims, slut shaming, never taking responsibility for their own behavior, selfish, spoiled, and narrow minded group that are very vocal about their twisted beliefs.  > I would have to ask you about how you define words aswell, by your logic.  words? they're ideas expressed by vocal, or written, mediums which symbolize ideas which have been generally unified in understanding over time, and then organized in a way to promote uniformity. but, pictures and gestures can be 'words' too (ie. pictographs & sign language)  1 of 2 (cont'd)",wisedoormat,1704983799,0,0,0,0

In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.  So it can be spun whatever way you like it... but it's shitty to ignore other people work being taken because of ""Robin is a real talent and we like him better"".

khd6zbi,AskReddit,"The body positivity movement is a recent development. I would argue that until recently, the US was a country that loved body shaming (look at the 2000s obsession with diet culture) and yet even back then the US had a very high obesity rate.   Keep in mind that Japan and Korea have a healthier cuisine than the US (most countries do, US food is a cholesterol festival and the US also serves notoriously big portions), which can also partly account for the fact that Japan and Korea have lower obesity rates.   Lots of different factors need to taken into account when comparing obesity rates, but basically all research into the effect of body shaming specifically shows the same conclusion.",guccipecorino,1704983639,0,0,0,0

This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais. So much so that he kept the entire German 15th army in Calais for an additional 7 weeks, allowing the allies vital time to build up a beachhead.",skrilledcheese,1704983913,0,0,0,0

If a politician is being pragmatic and saying we should legalize drug use under a regulated system, rather than making it illegal, their opponent will go to the constituents and say that guy wants to sell your kids drugs!  I think a similar argument can be made for prostitution.

khd7gxz,AskReddit,"Oh yeah. My son went through a colic phase. Fortunately it wasn’t as bad as some others I’ve heard of. He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”.

Since they are opinion based, i am not disagreeing with them, because that would be pointless. Pointing out what they are, though, does make any discussion about it's validity not necessary.  > How do you define gender?  me? it's a culturally recognized identity, which varies across geographical locations, cultures, demographics, and time periods.  There are sub categories of culturally recognized identities, which include man, woman, variations of the two on a spectrum, mixed gender, two-spirited, Muxe, Māhū, nádleehí, Ashtime, Chibados, Palao'ana, people considered to be neither man nor woman, Bakla, and so many more that would be ridiculous to list all here.  > or Incel?  my definition? an Incel, or involuntarily celebate, is someone who cannot engage in sexual activities with others. The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.  They are toxic, self-proclaimed-victims, slut shaming, never taking responsibility for their own behavior, selfish, spoiled, and narrow minded group that are very vocal about their twisted beliefs.  > I would have to ask you about how you define words aswell, by your logic.  words? they're ideas expressed by vocal, or written, mediums which symbolize ideas which have been generally unified in understanding over time, and then organized in a way to promote uniformity. but, pictures and gestures can be 'words' too (ie. pictographs & sign language)  1 of 2 (cont'd)",wisedoormat,1704983799,0,0,0,0

I would argue that until recently, the US was a country that loved body shaming (look at the 2000s obsession with diet culture) and yet even back then the US had a very high obesity rate.   Keep in mind that Japan and Korea have a healthier cuisine than the US (most countries do, US food is a cholesterol festival and the US also serves notoriously big portions), which can also partly account for the fact that Japan and Korea have lower obesity rates.   Lots of different factors need to taken into account when comparing obesity rates, but basically all research into the effect of body shaming specifically shows the same conclusion.",guccipecorino,1704983639,0,0,0,0

khd7vsn,AskReddit,"The thing is the difference between a ‘healthy bmi’ compared to an ‘obese bmi’ can be as little as a few extra 100 calories per day. For example, a woman my height (5’9) who is sedentary and weighs 220 pounds (so class 1 obese) requires 2100ish calories each day to maintain this weight. For a woman same height but weighing 160 pounds (a healthy bmi), you need to eat 1830ish a day to maintain. That is a difference of 2-300 calories. Like two extra slices of bread a day, or a few tablespoons of olive oil.  This is why the stereotypes of the gluttonous overweight person who eats everything in sight and the skinny person is who lives off cabbage soup and air doesn’t actually apply to most people. The vast majority of ‘naturally skinny’ people that I know are generally not habitual overeaters. But they also don’t starve themselves or eat accordingly to all the odd rules you might find from googling ‘how thin people eat.’ Most of that stuff is diet culture nonsense designed to make weight management and weight loss seem complicated and impossible.  Everyone is different ofcourse but the general rule of thumb is that overweight people regularly ate beyond the maintenance amount of calories needed for a healthy weight at their height. Some overweight people struggle with binge eating or emotional eating or generally having bigger appetites and cultural and family influences/ general ignorance about nutrition. And thin people ate within their maintenance, either because they are conscious about calories and nutrition or simply because of their cultural/family influences and general smaller appetite or lack of interest in food. I personally don’t subscribe to the idea of thin people and overweight people being massively genetically predetermined or victims of fate.

My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.

Since they are opinion based, i am not disagreeing with them, because that would be pointless. Pointing out what they are, though, does make any discussion about it's validity not necessary.  > How do you define gender?  me? it's a culturally recognized identity, which varies across geographical locations, cultures, demographics, and time periods.  There are sub categories of culturally recognized identities, which include man, woman, variations of the two on a spectrum, mixed gender, two-spirited, Muxe, Māhū, nádleehí, Ashtime, Chibados, Palao'ana, people considered to be neither man nor woman, Bakla, and so many more that would be ridiculous to list all here.  > or Incel?  my definition? an Incel, or involuntarily celebate, is someone who cannot engage in sexual activities with others. The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.  They are toxic, self-proclaimed-victims, slut shaming, never taking responsibility for their own behavior, selfish, spoiled, and narrow minded group that are very vocal about their twisted beliefs.  > I would have to ask you about how you define words aswell, by your logic.  words? they're ideas expressed by vocal, or written, mediums which symbolize ideas which have been generally unified in understanding over time, and then organized in a way to promote uniformity. but, pictures and gestures can be 'words' too (ie. pictographs & sign language)  1 of 2 (cont'd)",wisedoormat,1704983799,0,0,0,0

We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

I was always just told he did “consulting.” He went to law school but never actually practiced law, was (and remains) very physically fit and is, to use a weird term for a real person, a very dashing guy, appearance-wise.   A few years ago he was in a bizarre car accident which involved another driver plowing into his car at a stoplight; he was relatively unhurt but the car was totaled and they needed to cut him out of it. The other driver was arrested immediately at the scene because- and this is the really weird part to me- the cars immediately in front of AND behind him were unmarked police vehicles being driven by plainclothes cops. There was no local media coverage of the incident (it occurred at a major thoroughfare in a midsize American city) and nobody in my family ever heard what happened to the guy who hit him.   I am convinced, down to my bones, that my uncle spent the 90s as some sort of secret agent and his “car accident” was someone trying to take him out for it.",throwaway18911090,1704983854,0,0,0,0

As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

khd6nvv,AskReddit,"Denefits.   If you go to the dentist and need major work, there are fliers for companies offering to pay the bill and you pay them back.  But if you take the deal, it's not a low interest. It's a cumulative 26% interest rate on the entire price of the loan, even if you have paid part of the loan off.  They get away with it, because its not a loan. A loan is you borrowing money, and the government provides you many protections as a borrower. It's the investing money in you. Because they are the investors, they are the one with the legal protection.  Let me say that again: because they invest money in you, they have legal protection instead of you.  This can easily double the cost of your dental bill. Or worse. Getting out by paying off early? There are early repayment penalties.  They get away with it because you get scammed for a thousand dollars on a five hundred dollar bill, you pay it and complain, but they still get their money.  We used their financing to pay for complete dental removal, all teeth, and full implants, a full set, and all follow up care. The interest was set to be $42,000+ on a $24,000 investment.   Whatever you have experienced with payday lenders, this is much nastier and sneakier. It's been a couple of years since we went through it, so I forget some of the loopholes they used, but it's the must brutal ""loan"" I've ever even heard about.   We were able to get out of it because I am military, I have good credit, and my bank, USAA, backed us against them when we argued, and gave me an unsecured loan to pay the whole thing off.   This company preys on you when you need an emergency extraction, or your child needs dental work you can't pay for, and then they ruthlessly fuck you.  I cannot express how bad they are.

And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.

khd6nvv,AskReddit,"Denefits.   If you go to the dentist and need major work, there are fliers for companies offering to pay the bill and you pay them back.  But if you take the deal, it's not a low interest. It's a cumulative 26% interest rate on the entire price of the loan, even if you have paid part of the loan off.  They get away with it, because its not a loan. A loan is you borrowing money, and the government provides you many protections as a borrower. It's the investing money in you. Because they are the investors, they are the one with the legal protection.  Let me say that again: because they invest money in you, they have legal protection instead of you.  This can easily double the cost of your dental bill. Or worse. Getting out by paying off early? There are early repayment penalties.  They get away with it because you get scammed for a thousand dollars on a five hundred dollar bill, you pay it and complain, but they still get their money.  We used their financing to pay for complete dental removal, all teeth, and full implants, a full set, and all follow up care. The interest was set to be $42,000+ on a $24,000 investment.   Whatever you have experienced with payday lenders, this is much nastier and sneakier. It's been a couple of years since we went through it, so I forget some of the loopholes they used, but it's the must brutal ""loan"" I've ever even heard about.   We were able to get out of it because I am military, I have good credit, and my bank, USAA, backed us against them when we argued, and gave me an unsecured loan to pay the whole thing off.   This company preys on you when you need an emergency extraction, or your child needs dental work you can't pay for, and then they ruthlessly fuck you.  I cannot express how bad they are. Put your dental bill on a 29% interest credit card, you will be better off.",111110001011,1704983516,0,0,0,0

Those parents will be punishing themselves harder than a jail cell ever could for the rest of their lives.  It's not negligence because the parent was playing Candy Crush on their phone and left the kid in the car. Or the case of the grandmother, [Tracey Nix](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/florida-woman-manslaughter-hot-car-b2310613.html), who had it happen *twice* to the same son and daughter-in-law's kids while she was babysitting and they died. Those cases should be assessed for what they are.   But I can't judge a parent who leaves their kid in the car accidentally after a grocery trip, for example, and never had any prior major lapses, because it's such a horrific circumstance that I can't even imagine.

khd6se2,AskReddit,"One explanation that's actually rather boring is that we don't have very good ways of detecting life, and that life may very well be rare enough that most instances of life will appear so far from one another (spatially or temporally) that they'll almost never interact.  We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

khd7gxz,AskReddit,"Oh yeah. My son went through a colic phase. Fortunately it wasn’t as bad as some others I’ve heard of. He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”.

khd6se2,AskReddit,"One explanation that's actually rather boring is that we don't have very good ways of detecting life, and that life may very well be rare enough that most instances of life will appear so far from one another (spatially or temporally) that they'll almost never interact.  We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”.

Like many comedians have discussed on podcasts about how if Robin was in a room while you did your sets, parts of your sets would get ""repurposed"" by Robin which was a bigger name and burns the material you came up with, as the smaller comic looks like the thief after Robin does it.  In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.  So it can be spun whatever way you like it... but it's shitty to ignore other people work being taken because of ""Robin is a real talent and we like him better"".  I like Robin Williams as an actor etc.  I can easily see how many in the industry have mixed feeling when he stole parts of their acts regardless of his intent and they could not get away with doing the same because they were not ""as big"" as Robin Willams.",SkullRunner,1704983713,0,0,0,0

This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais.

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”. So now if I’m sleep deprived it’s because I make poor choices for myself, but there’s a reason we’re a one and done family.

khd7dte,AskReddit,"Possibly not.  As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

But its kinda like asking ""are you dumb?"" technically its not directly an insult, but you should know that how its taken.  i can understand how one may take it as an insult if you're defensive about such associations. It's not the default reaction, imo.  I can say 'that is incel tier language' and the person could have no association with them, or fear of being associated with them, and react with 'wow, really? how so?'. then a dicussion can follow where it's explained. They are now more aware of what the idea conveys.  myself, i was raised in a racist community and have since made huge efforts to separate my upbringing from who i want to be. I didnt' think of myself as racist, and i would use terms like 'the blacks' thinking it was an acceptable alternative to the n-word. when i got called out on it, i genuinely didn't know it was language normally used by racists people. Instead of denial, or bringing up many other topics that surround it, i asked why it was racist language.

Did the pipes play ""The Flowers of the Forest""?   And did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind?   In some loyal heart is your memory enshrined?   And though you died back in 1916   To that faithful heart are you always nineteen?

You and your higher salary will be the first to go or the first with your salary cut.   And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

So, spacetime is being sent from all times in the universe to the start of the universe, giving something to “bang” with. As spacetime is removed, things are pulled further away.

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”. So now if I’m sleep deprived it’s because I make poor choices for myself, but there’s a reason we’re a one and done family.

For the longest time it drove me insane as I generally eat healthy, and she is completely addicted to sweets. Until a couple of years ago I noted two things: 1. Besides candy she eats very little. On most days, she eats half her lunch, barely any breakfast and usually nothing much for dinner. 2. We are both emotional eaters, but when I am distressed i binge and when she is distressed she refuses to eat.  Now, none of those behaviors is healthy and she is making an effort to move a healthier lifestyle, but...this is how she is naturally thin..  Edit: this comment blew up so for everyone expressing concern: no, my wife doesn't have an eating disorder.

khd7f6g,AskReddit,"This is true in IT office work. Skills or not, if youre older and have the skills, you cost more than the younger who has skills and not worth it to the company long-term.  You and your higher salary will be the first to go or the first with your salary cut.   And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais. So much so that he kept the entire German 15th army in Calais for an additional 7 weeks, allowing the allies vital time to build up a beachhead.",skrilledcheese,1704983913,0,0,0,0

I can say 'that is incel tier language' and the person could have no association with them, or fear of being associated with them, and react with 'wow, really? how so?'. then a dicussion can follow where it's explained. They are now more aware of what the idea conveys.  myself, i was raised in a racist community and have since made huge efforts to separate my upbringing from who i want to be. I didnt' think of myself as racist, and i would use terms like 'the blacks' thinking it was an acceptable alternative to the n-word. when i got called out on it, i genuinely didn't know it was language normally used by racists people. Instead of denial, or bringing up many other topics that surround it, i asked why it was racist language. They explained, i listened, had a few exchanges of this, and now i know better.",wisedoormat,1704983817,0,0,0,0

You and your higher salary will be the first to go or the first with your salary cut.   And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”.

khd6nvv,AskReddit,"Denefits.   If you go to the dentist and need major work, there are fliers for companies offering to pay the bill and you pay them back.  But if you take the deal, it's not a low interest. It's a cumulative 26% interest rate on the entire price of the loan, even if you have paid part of the loan off.  They get away with it, because its not a loan. A loan is you borrowing money, and the government provides you many protections as a borrower. It's the investing money in you. Because they are the investors, they are the one with the legal protection.  Let me say that again: because they invest money in you, they have legal protection instead of you.  This can easily double the cost of your dental bill. Or worse. Getting out by paying off early? There are early repayment penalties.  They get away with it because you get scammed for a thousand dollars on a five hundred dollar bill, you pay it and complain, but they still get their money.  We used their financing to pay for complete dental removal, all teeth, and full implants, a full set, and all follow up care. The interest was set to be $42,000+ on a $24,000 investment.   Whatever you have experienced with payday lenders, this is much nastier and sneakier. It's been a couple of years since we went through it, so I forget some of the loopholes they used, but it's the must brutal ""loan"" I've ever even heard about.   We were able to get out of it because I am military, I have good credit, and my bank, USAA, backed us against them when we argued, and gave me an unsecured loan to pay the whole thing off.   This company preys on you when you need an emergency extraction, or your child needs dental work you can't pay for, and then they ruthlessly fuck you.  I cannot express how bad they are. Put your dental bill on a 29% interest credit card, you will be better off.",111110001011,1704983516,0,0,0,0

Part of what allows people to live so well in the west is importing cheaply made goods from countries with lax labour laws. Often the workers manufacturing these goods have few rights and work for starvation wages.   Many employers in America hire illegal immigrants, pay them less than minimum wage, put them up in a big house with a bunch of people in each room, deduct housing costs from their pay and threaten to deport them if they don't obey.  You could put your fingers in your ears and close your eyes and tell yourself these two groups of people do not resemble slaves if you want, but both of these groups of people are basically slaves and the modern American economy is dependent on them.",Vivid_Barracuda1246,1704983783,0,0,0,0

Since they are opinion based, i am not disagreeing with them, because that would be pointless. Pointing out what they are, though, does make any discussion about it's validity not necessary.  > How do you define gender?  me? it's a culturally recognized identity, which varies across geographical locations, cultures, demographics, and time periods.  There are sub categories of culturally recognized identities, which include man, woman, variations of the two on a spectrum, mixed gender, two-spirited, Muxe, Māhū, nádleehí, Ashtime, Chibados, Palao'ana, people considered to be neither man nor woman, Bakla, and so many more that would be ridiculous to list all here.  > or Incel?  my definition? an Incel, or involuntarily celebate, is someone who cannot engage in sexual activities with others. The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.  They are toxic, self-proclaimed-victims, slut shaming, never taking responsibility for their own behavior, selfish, spoiled, and narrow minded group that are very vocal about their twisted beliefs.  > I would have to ask you about how you define words aswell, by your logic.  words? they're ideas expressed by vocal, or written, mediums which symbolize ideas which have been generally unified in understanding over time, and then organized in a way to promote uniformity. but, pictures and gestures can be 'words' too (ie. pictographs & sign language)  1 of 2 (cont'd)",wisedoormat,1704983799,0,0,0,0

We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

And then, sometimes, as with Idaho Power, they mass reduce a group of workers pay (e.g., Devs, DBAs, BAs, etc.) the closer that group of workers is to retirement age because your last 5 years of salary is what determines your pension.  So if you make less that last 5 years, you get less on your pension because your overall salary is lower. And they hope you’ll quit over it so they can hire in new, younger, less expensive workers.

Since they are opinion based, i am not disagreeing with them, because that would be pointless. Pointing out what they are, though, does make any discussion about it's validity not necessary.  > How do you define gender?  me? it's a culturally recognized identity, which varies across geographical locations, cultures, demographics, and time periods.  There are sub categories of culturally recognized identities, which include man, woman, variations of the two on a spectrum, mixed gender, two-spirited, Muxe, Māhū, nádleehí, Ashtime, Chibados, Palao'ana, people considered to be neither man nor woman, Bakla, and so many more that would be ridiculous to list all here.  > or Incel?  my definition? an Incel, or involuntarily celebate, is someone who cannot engage in sexual activities with others. The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.  They are toxic, self-proclaimed-victims, slut shaming, never taking responsibility for their own behavior, selfish, spoiled, and narrow minded group that are very vocal about their twisted beliefs.  > I would have to ask you about how you define words aswell, by your logic.  words? they're ideas expressed by vocal, or written, mediums which symbolize ideas which have been generally unified in understanding over time, and then organized in a way to promote uniformity. but, pictures and gestures can be 'words' too (ie. pictographs & sign language)  1 of 2 (cont'd)",wisedoormat,1704983799,0,0,0,0

Keep in mind that Japan and Korea have a healthier cuisine than the US (most countries do, US food is a cholesterol festival and the US also serves notoriously big portions), which can also partly account for the fact that Japan and Korea have lower obesity rates.

Why would teachers get paid $100,000 when it’s very easy to become a teacher?  I had a friend who was sick and tired of the grind working in IT. She decided to become a teacher so she could have summers off. She had zero teaching experience. Started off as a substitute teacher for a while and transitioned to becoming full time teacher. Happened within one year time. All these “underpaid” jobs will start paying more when there is a shortage of people to fill these jobs.

I was always just told he did “consulting.” He went to law school but never actually practiced law, was (and remains) very physically fit and is, to use a weird term for a real person, a very dashing guy, appearance-wise.   A few years ago he was in a bizarre car accident which involved another driver plowing into his car at a stoplight; he was relatively unhurt but the car was totaled and they needed to cut him out of it. The other driver was arrested immediately at the scene because- and this is the really weird part to me- the cars immediately in front of AND behind him were unmarked police vehicles being driven by plainclothes cops. There was no local media coverage of the incident (it occurred at a major thoroughfare in a midsize American city) and nobody in my family ever heard what happened to the guy who hit him.   I am convinced, down to my bones, that my uncle spent the 90s as some sort of secret agent and his “car accident” was someone trying to take him out for it.",throwaway18911090,1704983854,0,0,0,0

The orgins of the group were people with physical disfigurments or other types of disabilites that people, in general, do not find an attraction towards. It is these founding members of the group that do have valid reasons to feel empathy and compassion for.  Over time, with more online exposure, along with their own core views on their situations, the ideology of the group shifted from 'this sucks' to 'we're being persecuted by others for not making themselves available to us but will slut around with entire teams'. My understanding it is ideology that was pushed/brought with more people that just claim they are incel but are in fact just shitty people to be around. It's this shift in ideology, and group demographics, that has created the current conception of what Incels are.  they were further co-opted into overlapping ideals, and calls to actions, by far-right groups, race-suprimist groups, mgtow, and some group think that women should be offering their boddies to them, or all men, at all times.

khd7dte,AskReddit,"Possibly not.  As it turned out the Germans didn't really have good aerial reconnaissance of England, and had already believed their intelligence network, not knowing it had been largely invented by double agent Juan Pujol Garcia (aka Garbo).    They were fed false information about the D-Day landings in particular, and that a small force would be landing in Normandy, with the main force following a few days later in Calais.  This resulted in the Germans delaying on any troop movements to defend the Normandy region until it was too late.   So the inflatable tanks, used to make it look like there were huge camps set up ready to invade Calais turned out to be superfluous, but they didn't know that at the time.   If there had been reconnaissance flights over the region that revealed where the troops were really going, it could have gone very badly for the Allies.  On smaller scales, decoy camps and airfields were set up in North Africa and in the Pacific, and even if they only fooled a handful of ground attack fighters or bombers, without any major strategic success, it still would have been pretty significant for those camps or troops that didn't get attacked because of those decoys.",haysoos2,1704983798,0,0,0,0

Do you know how much the sales of those books paid me in 2023? $1,267.13.

We've been sending signals into the void for a long time but they only have had time to reach a small patch of our local space. And *even then* you'd need some very beefy detectors to actually pick them up, pointed precisely in the right direction and at the right time.  If intelligent life such as us is actually so rare that it only occurs a few times in each galaxy, or even a few times in our local cluster, we're basically never going to find any statistically speaking because we're limited by the speed of light. Even looking for indirect signs isn't perfect, such as observing stars for evidence of megastructures, because you can't tell that either without prolonged observation and (again) the speed of light is limiting.  On FTL, I think it's almost definitely impossible. The alternative is worse, in many ways, because FTL travel *is* time travel. And time travel, the breaking of causality, is a worrying concept for our reality.  All that's before even considering a great filter.

This phantom force was ""stationed"" across from Calais, which was the closest part of France to England, therefore a logical place to attack.   FUSAG had fake communication stations set up to give fake radio orders all day long to fake brigades. They moved the vehicles around and left tracks in fields to convince any aerial reconnaissance. FUSAG was ""commanded"" by George Patton, who was quasi suspended after slapping shell-shocked troops in Sicily, but he was the general that the Germans feared the most. Plus, there were intelligence and counterintelligence aspects as well. Notably, the British turned several Axis spies into double agents and had them feeding misinformation to the axis high command about Calais being the invasion site.  This deception operation as a whole worked exceedingly well. In the lead up to the invasion the Germans overly focused on fortifying Calais, and if not for Rommel being assigned the beaches of normandy would have been relatively easy to take. Plus the placement of stockpiles of ammo and armored reinforcements were impacted by the uncertainty and deception. And after normandy was invaded, Hitler was convinced it was a feint attack, and the real attack would happen at Calais.

He went only about 4-5 weeks (he was 8 weeks old when it finally stopped) before he grew out of it. That was the longest month of my life. He would just cry and cry and cry for hours every single night and nothing would stop it. I never understood before how someone could shake a baby to hurt them, but then going through that I now get it. I understand why pediatricians and doctors tell you “when you get to that point, put the baby in a safe place and just walk away”. There were a couple of times when I had to just put him in his crib and let him cry while I went and stood in the shower with the water running (it drowned out the noise) just so I could calm down.   I got to the point where I was so tired I was hallucinating too. I was probably getting maybe 2-3 hours (not consecutive either, like an hour here or hour there) a day for that entire time. I would close my eyes and see giant baby heads everywhere. It was weird. I wasn’t working though, so I never went anywhere which was good. I also had my mom come over and help out so I could nap. My mom is the reason I kept any sanity at all.   Somehow, fortunately, once we got past that stage my son ended up being a really great sleeper. He started sleeping through the night (no wake ups, just solid sleep) around 12 weeks old and never really had any major sleep regressions. He’s three now and I swear we got a “unicorn sleeper”.

In the social media age of today, you get called out now if you do this, and people stop working with you in the clubs.  So it can be spun whatever way you like it... but it's shitty to ignore other people work being taken because of ""Robin is a real talent and we like him better"".

khd7mhn,AskReddit,"I'm a guy struggling with weight, and my wife is exactly the same BMI 21 she was when we met 13 years ago. For the longest time it drove me insane as I generally eat healthy, and she is completely addicted to sweets. Until a couple of years ago I noted two things: 1. Besides candy she eats very little. On most days, she eats half her lunch, barely any breakfast and usually nothing much for dinner. 2. We are both emotional eaters, but when I am distressed i binge and when she is distressed she refuses to eat.  Now, none of those behaviors is healthy and she is making an effort to move a healthier lifestyle, but...this is how she is naturally thin..  Edit: this comment blew up so for everyone expressing concern: no, my wife doesn't have an eating disorder. And to her great credit, she started weight lifting in our home gym, and her diet is not nearly as bad as it used to be, though the still has massive sweet tooth.",InsidewBaseballe,1704983894,0,0,0,0

It’s just silly people ignoring all the actual evidence we have about neurology and memory to make themselves feel smart.   It’s possibly the lamest of these kinds of theories too.
